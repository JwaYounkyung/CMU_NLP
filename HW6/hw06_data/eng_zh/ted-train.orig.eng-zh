 We started something called the Speech Project; curbing abuse, expanding freedom. ||| 我哋開頭建立名為 Speech Project 嘅網站 抵制網路暴力，伸張自由 
 But we do provide on that website a standardized list of definitions, because it's hard to attack a behavior in the right way if we're not all sharing a definition of what that behavior is. ||| 但係我哋可以做嘅就係 喺呢個網站度列出明確嘅定義 因為如果我哋無統一界定標準 就唔可以準確打擊暴力

 But you know who didn't like that chapter? ||| 你估咩人會唔鍾意嗰一章？ 
 The US government. ||| 美國政府 
 That is, until just days before the trial, when a curious thing happened. ||| 就喺審判前幾日，有樣奇怪事發生咗 
 And instead of trying and failing to have Risen testify, they could have his digital trail testify against him instead. ||| 與其一次又一次被 James 拒絕舉證 政府可以用佢嘅電子記錄 嚟指證 Jeffrey Sterling 
 So completely in secret and without his consent, prosecutors got Risen's phone records. ||| 於是喺完全機密而且未經同意嘅情況下 控方攞到 James 嘅電話紀錄 
 Sadly, this is only one case of many. ||| 好遺憾，呢一類嘅事成千上萬 
 Since 9/11, virtually every important story about national security has been the result of a whistleblower coming to a journalist. ||| 9.11 之後，基本上所有 關於國家安全嘅重大新聞 都係由告密者提供畀記者嘅 
 Thank you. ||| 多謝 
 I'll start with when I was eight years old. ||| 我會由我八歲嗰時講起 
 I took a wood box, and I buried a dollar bill, a pen and a fork inside this box in Colorado. ||| 我喺科羅拉多嗰陣拎咗個木盒 放咗一蚊美金、一枝筆 同一隻叉喺個盒入面 
 Then I made some weird insects and creatures. ||| 然後又畫咗啲奇怪嘅昆蟲同生物 
 It was really fun; I was just drawing on the layers of resin. ||| 喺一層層嘅樹脂上面畫畫真係好好玩 
 And I went to bed every night thinking about it. ||| 晚晚我瞓覺之前都喺度諗點樣先好 
 So I tried using glass. ||| 於是我試下用玻璃 
 It weighs 24,000 pounds. ||| 佢有 24,000 磅重、18 呎長 
 It's double-sided, so it's 36 feet of composition. ||| 雙面嘅，所以其實係 36 呎長 
 Anyway, this is a lady creature. ||| 呢個係一隻雌性物物 
 That's her hand that she's spitting into. ||| 佢吐油落隻手度 
 "Then she has an 18-foot-long serpent's tail that connects ""The Triptych."" Anyway, her tail catches on fire from the back of the volcano." ||| 佢仲有一條 18 尺長嘅蛇尾連住幅畫 但佢條尾俾火山燒著咗 
 They're like cells — they come together, they divide. ||| 佢哋就好似細胞咁 
 This one has a little cave in his chest. ||| 呢個人心口度有一個窿 
 That's his head; there's the chest, you can kind of see the beginning. ||| 呢個係佢個頭，呢個係個胸 
 That's a body getting split in half. ||| 呢個人形嘅身體斷開兩截 
 This box we're in, the solar system is a box. ||| 我哋身處喺太陽系其實都好似一個盒 
 Thank you very much. ||| 好多謝大家！ 
 They're out there because they need to eat. ||| 佢地之所以出動，係因為要搵食 
 In parts of the world where there are no bees, or where they plant varieties that are not attractive to bees, people are paid to do the business of pollination by hand. ||| 喺無蜂嘅地方 或者無植物啱蜂心水嘅地方 只能夠俾錢請人做人工授粉 
 It was like the best of science fiction come true. ||| 就好似一本超精彩科幻小說嘅真實版 
 So I went to work for a commercial beekeeper, a family that owned 2,000 hives of bees in New Mexico. ||| 於是，我去咗幫一個養蜂商人打工 佢成家喺新墨西哥州，擁有兩千個蜂巢 
 And I was permanently hooked. ||| 從此，我同蜜蜂結下不解之緣 
 So in my lab, we study how bees keep themselves healthy. ||| 我嘅實驗室研究蜜蜂點樣維持健康 
 We've found that propolis is a natural disinfectant. ||| 大家都知道蜂膠係一種天然殺菌劑 
 It's a natural antibiotic. ||| 又係天然抗生素 
 It kills off bacteria and molds and other germs within the colony, and so it bolsters the colony health and their social immunity. ||| 佢可以將蜂群入邊嘅細菌、霉菌 仲有其他病菌殺死 確保蜂群健康，增強群體免疫力 
 In our collective conscience, in a really primal way, we know we can't afford to lose bees. ||| 好簡單，從我哋嘅認知 我哋知道人類 承受唔到冇蜜蜂嘅後果 
 So what's going on? ||| 咁究竟發生咗咩一回事？ 
 Bees are dying from multiple and interacting causes, and I'll go through each of these. ||| 蜜蜂死於多種互相影響嘅因素 陣間我會逐一講解 
 We're down to about two million hives of bees, we think. ||| 我哋估計剩返二百萬個蜂箱 
 We stopped planting clover and alfalfa, which are natural fertilizers that fix nitrogen in the soil, and instead we started using synthetic fertilizers. ||| 好似三葉草同苜蓿咁 佢哋都係天然嘅土壤固氮肥料 但係宜家大家都用化肥代替 
 Clover and alfalfa are highly nutritious food plants for bees. ||| 三葉草同苜蓿都係蜂類嘅高級營養品 
 And we started growing larger and larger crop monocultures. ||| 同時，單一作物嘅種植規模越來越大 
 Now we talk about food deserts, places in our cities, neighborhoods that have no grocery stores. ||| 我哋宜家講「食物荒漠」 正係指城市裏邊、社區附近 買唔到多款食物 
 And then there's pesticides. ||| 跟住講下殺蟲劑 
 This small bee is holding up a large mirror. ||| 蜜蜂令我哋問︰ 
 You've probably heard about it. ||| 你可能都聽過 
 This is a new class of insecticides. ||| 佢係新型殺蟲劑 
 And it's not just our honeybees. ||| 唔止蜜蜂，所有野生蜂都喺危險邊緣 
 These bees are providing backup for our honeybees. ||| 佢哋係蜜蜂嘅後援 
 So what are we going to do? ||| 咁要點做？ 
 What are we going to do about this big bee bummer that we've created? ||| 我哋為蜂類整咗咁大麻煩 點先可以補到鑊？ 
 Set aside farmland. ||| 唔講農田，我哋要種唔同品種嘅花 
 And we need to diversify our farms. ||| 農場都需要多樣化種植 
 So let the small act of planting flowers and keeping them free of pesticides be the driver of large-scale change. ||| 所以，依家就等我哋開始種花 唔加任何農藥 一齊帶領改變呢片大地嘅顏色 
 On behalf of the bees, thank you. ||| 我代表蜂類多謝你哋 
 (Applause) Chris Anderson: Thank you. Just a quick question. ||| （掌聲） Chris Anderson：多謝 想問一個問題 
 The latest numbers on the die-off of bees, is there any sign of things bottoming out? ||| 從最近蜜蜂死亡嘅數字睇 蜂類嘅數量有冇觸底反彈？ 
 What's your hope/depression level on this? ||| 你對數字樂觀定失望？ 
 Maria Spivak: Yeah. ||| 講者：嗯 
 CA: That's not 30 percent a year, that's — MS: Yes, thirty percent a year. ||| - Chris Anderson：唔係三成嗎？ - 講者︰無錯係三成 
 We're kind of at a tipping point. ||| 但目前正係臨界點 
 We can't really afford to lose that many more. ||| 蜂巢已經唔可以再少 
 For much of this time, this assistance was manual. ||| 好多時協助監聽嘅工作係靠人手 
 Calls were recorded to tape. ||| 線路裏面嘅通話會被錄到去錄音帶裡邊 
 The telephone companies built surveillance features into the very core of their networks. ||| 電話公司喺佢哋網路嘅核心地方 設置咗監聽功能 
 But while the telephone companies have built surveillance as a priority, Silicon Valley companies have not. ||| 但當電話公司以監聽為首要嘅時候 矽谷嘅科技公司就冇噉樣做 
 And in fact, that's what's happening. ||| 而且事實上 
 Now, look — I'm extremely sympathetic to their point of view. ||| 我宜家對於佢哋嘅睇法超級同情 
 But those surveillance features come at a cost. ||| 但係呢啲監控工作係有成本嘅 
 We all use the same communications devices. ||| 我哋都用梗同一樣通訊設備 
 And I don't want to live in that kind of world. ||| 而我唔想活喺噉樣嘅世界裡面 
 And so, my message to you is this: We need to use these tools. ||| 所以我想帶出嘅訊息係 我哋需要用呢啲工具 
 We need to secure our telephone calls. ||| 去保障我哋通話同短訊嘅保安 
 I want you to use these tools. ||| 我希望你哋利用呢啲工具

 Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals. ||| 意志係熱情加恆心

 There'd been a mistake. ||| 科隆歌劇院搞錯咗 
 So Keith Jarrett left. ||| 所以 Keith 走咗

 He had embraced that mess, and it soared. ||| 但佢接受咗，仲將佢搞好 
 But let's think for a moment about Jarrett's initial instinct. ||| 等我哋諗一諗 Keith 最初嘅反應 
 We don't want to be asked to do good work with bad tools. ||| 我哋都唔希望人哋叫我哋 用差嘅工具做好一件事 
 And I think our instinct is also wrong. ||| 我認為我哋嘅判斷都係錯嘅 
 So cognitive psychology first. ||| 我哋由認知心理學開始

 And I said to myself, well, what is the conclusion? ||| 然後我同自己講，噉又點？ 
 It's called Ultra-Ever Dry, and when you apply it to any material, it turns into a superhydrophobic shield. ||| 叫做「超乾燥保護漆」 當你噴佢喺任何物料上面 就會形成一層超跣水保護膜 
 So this is a cinder block, uncoated, and you can see that it's porous, it absorbs water. ||| 煤磚嘅另一邊無噴過噴霧 你可以睇到 磚一邊有窿、可以滲透、吸水 
 Not anymore. ||| 另一邊就唔同啦 
 Porous, nonporous. ||| 哩邊可滲透，哩邊不可滲透 
 So what's superhydrophobic? ||| 咁超跣水係咩嘢呢？ 
 A windshield coating is going to give you about 110 degrees. ||| 喺擋風玻璃上面就大約 110 度 
 But what you're seeing here is 160 to 175 degrees, and anything over 150 is superhydrophobic. ||| 但係你喺哩度見到嘅 就有 160 度至 175 度 而任何超過 150 度嘅，就係超跣水 
 And we're talking really small here. ||| 我哋講緊嘅層面真係好細 
 So very small, but very useful. ||| 所以係非常細小，但係非常有用 
 And it's not just water that this works with. ||| 唔單止用嚟防水 
 You can see the difference. ||| 你可以睇到兩隻手套嘅分別 
 So what are the applications? ||| 咁有咩嘢應用呢？ 
 I mean, many of you right now are probably going through your head. ||| 我估大家依家都諗繄哩個問題 
 We've certainly seen that today. ||| 塗料除咗做到防水之外 
 It could be anything that's anti-icing, because if you don't have water, you don't have ice. ||| 可以防結冰 因為你無水，你就無冰 
 It could be anti-corrosion. ||| 佢亦可以防腐蝕 
 No water, no corrosion. ||| 因為無水，無腐蝕 
 It could be anti-bacterial. ||| 仲可以防菌 
 Without water, the bacteria won't survive. ||| 細菌唔可以喺無水嘅情況下生存 
 And it could be things that need to be self-cleaning as well. ||| 亦可以用喺需要自動清洗嘅物件上 
 So imagine how something like this could help revolutionize your field of work. ||| 所以，想像一下類似嘅發明 點樣可以革新你嘅行業 
 And I'm going to leave you with one last demonstration, but before I do that, I would like to say thank you, and think small. ||| 最後，我做一個示範 但喺我示範之前，我希望講聲多謝 同埋想你哋思考細微嘅事物 
 (Applause) It's going to happen. Wait for it. Wait for it. ||| （掌聲） 個 D 字就快出嚟啦。等陣，等陣 
 Chris Anderson: You guys didn't hear about us cutting out the Design from TED? (Laughter) [Two minutes later...] He ran into all sorts of problems in terms of managing the medical research part. ||| Chris Anderson：你哋無聽講過  TED 唔再講求 Design 設計咩？（笑聲） [ 兩分鐘後… ] 佢做醫學研究嗰陣遇到各種問題 
 It's happening! ||| D 字出嚟啦！ 
 (Applause) ||| （掌聲）

 I've spent the last decade subjecting myself to pain and humiliation, hopefully for a good cause, which is self-improvement. ||| 我花咗過去10年 飽受痛苦同屈辱， 就喺為咗一個好嘅原因： 自我提升。 
 And I've done this in three parts. ||| 我從三個方向入手， 
 So first I started with the mind. ||| 首先喺由個腦入手。 
 "And I decided to try to get smarter by reading the entire Encyclopedia Britannica from A to Z — or, more precisely, from ""a-ak"" to ""Zywiec."" And here's a little image of that." ||| 我決定要睇晒大英百科全書 嚟令自己變聰明啲 我由字母A到Z 更準確啲,係由a-ak到Zywiec都睇晒。 依張喺全系列書嘅相。 
 And this was an amazing year. ||| 依個喺好精彩嘅一年， 
 It was really a fascinating journey. ||| 而且亦係一個好有趣嘅旅程， 
 It was painful at times, especially for those around me. ||| 不過都有痛苦嘅時候， 特別喺對於果啲喺我身邊嘅人。 
 My wife started to fine me one dollar for every irrelevant fact I inserted into conversation. ||| 每次我係傾計時候加入無關嘅冷知識， 我老婆就會罰我1美金， 
 So it had its downsides. ||| 所以依個旅程其實都有缺點。 
 But after that, I decided to work on the spirit. ||| 不過之後 我確定要開始我嘅精神提升。 
 As I mentioned last year, I grew up with no religion at all. ||| 上年我講過 我一直都無信仰。 
 I'm Jewish, but I'm Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian. ||| 我喺猶太人， 但喺就好似“橄欖花園”喺意大利餐廳一樣。 
 (Laughter) Not really. ||| （笑聲） 其實唔係。 
 But I decided to learn about the Bible and my heritage by actually diving in and trying to live it and immerse myself in it. ||| 我決定要通過親身經歷 嚟學習《聖經》 同埋我嘅民族歷史。 
 So I decided to follow all the rules of the Bible. ||| 我跟足《聖經》同《十誡》 
 And from the Ten Commandments to growing my beard — because Leviticus says you cannot shave. ||| 入邊所有嘅規矩， 譬如話留鬚 — 因為《利未記》提到唔畀剃鬚。 
 So this is what I looked like by the end. ||| 依個就係我留咗一年鬚嘅樣啦。 
 Thank you for that reaction. ||| 多謝你哋嘅反應。 
 (Laughter) I look a little like Moses, or Ted Kaczynski. ||| （笑聲） 我望落有啲似摩西，或者泰德·卡欽斯基， 
 I got both of them. ||| 兩個都有啲啦。 
 So there was the topiary there. ||| 修剪過後就咁嘅樣。 
 And there's the sheep. ||| 仲有隻綿羊。 
 Now the final part of the trilogy was I wanted to focus on the body and try to be the healthiest person I could be, the healthiest person alive. ||| 到三部曲嘅最後一部， 我想將重點放喺身體， 我嘗試活得健康， 成為最健康嘅人。 
 So that's what I've been doing the last couple of years. ||| 我過去幾年就喺做緊依樣嘢， 
 And I just finished a couple of months ago. ||| 幾個月前啱啱結束。 
 And I have to say, thank God. ||| 我想講：感謝上帝！ 
 Because living so healthily was killing me. ||| 因為咁健康咁生活真喺好攞命。 
 (Laughter) It was so overwhelming, because the amount of things you have to do, it's just mind-boggling. ||| （笑聲） 真喺好難頂， 因為你要做好多好多嘢， 多到難以置信。 
 I was listening to all the experts and talking to sort of a board of medical advisers. ||| 我聽取所有專家嘅意見 仲同好多醫學專家傾過計， 
 And they were telling me all the things I had to do. ||| 佢哋個個都話我知 我要做嘅嘢。 
 I had to eat right, exercise, meditate, pet dogs, because that lowers the blood pressure. ||| 我要正確咁飲食、 做運動、冥想同埋養狗， 因為咁做可以降低血壓。 
 I wrote the book on a treadmill, and it took me about a thousand miles to write the book. ||| 我喺跑步機上邊跑邊寫書， 用咗我大概跑1000公里嘅時間 嚟寫一本書。 
 I had to put on sunscreen. ||| 我仲要搽太陽油。 
 This was no small feat, because if you listen to dermatologists, they say that you should have a shot glass full of sunscreen. ||| 好大工程。 如果你聽皮膚科醫生嘅話， 你需要搽一個細酒杯嘅份量， 
 And you have to reapply it every two to four hours. ||| 而且每四個鐘就要補搽一次。 
 So I think half of my book advance went into sunscreen. ||| 我估有一半寫書嘅時間， 係用咗嚟搽太陽油。 
 I was like a glazed doughnut for most of the year. ||| 我變成一隻上咗油嘅東甩 有差唔多一年。 
 There was the washing of hands. ||| 然後到洗手。 
 I had to do that properly. ||| 我要好認真咁洗。 
 And my immunologist told me that I should also wipe down all of the remote controls and iPhones in my house, because those are just orgies of germs. ||| 我個免疫醫生話， 我仲要抹乾淨 屋企所有遙控同手機， 因為佢哋都喺細菌嘅樂園。 
 So that took a lot of time. ||| 用咗我好多時間。 
 I also tried to be the safest person I could be, because that's a part of health. ||| 我仲開始好小心咁生活 因為佢係健康嘅一部份。 
 I was inspired by the Danish Safety Council. ||| 我受到 我受到丹麥安全局嘅啓發， 
 "They started a public campaign that says, ""A walking helmet is a good helmet."" So they believe you should not just wear helmets for biking, but also for walking around." ||| 佢哋推廣一個運動, 倡議： “步行安全帽係一頂好帽” 佢哋認為唔單止踩車嘅時候要戴安全帽， 行路嘅時候都要。 
 And you can see there they're shopping with their helmets. ||| 然後你睇 佢哋去行街都戴安全帽。 
 (Laughter) Well yeah, I tried that. ||| （笑聲） 係呀，我都試咗。 
 Now it's a little extreme, I admit. ||| 宜家我承認係有啲極端， 
 "But if you think about this, this is actually — the ""Freakonomics"" authors wrote about this — that more people die on a per mile basis from drunk walking than from drunk driving." ||| 但係如果你諗諗， 正如“魔鬼經濟學”嘅作家所寫 — 每公里，因為飲醉酒 而死嘅行人 仲多過因醉酒駕駛而死。 
 So something to think about tonight if you've had a couple. ||| 如果你飲咗啲酒， 咁你今晚就要諗下喇。 
 So I finished, and it was a success in a sense. ||| 我最終都完成咗依個計劃， 而亦可以話喺成功嘅。 
 All of the markers went in the right direction. ||| 所有指數都朝住正確嘅方向發展， 
 My cholesterol went down, I lost weight, my wife stopped telling me that I looked pregnant. ||| 我嘅膽固醇降低咗，體重減少咗， 我老婆唔再話我好似有咗咁。 
 So that was nice. ||| 所以幾好， 
 And it was successful overall. ||| 總體嚟講幾成功。 
 But I also learned that I was too healthy, and that was unhealthy. ||| 但係我都意識到我太健康喇， 而咁樣其實係唔健康。 
 I was so focused on doing all these things that I was neglecting my friends and family. ||| 我太專注做所有嘅嘢， 而忽略咗我嘅屋企人同朋友。 
 And as Dan Buettner can tell you, having a strong social network is so crucial to our health. ||| 好似丹·拔拿講咁 一個強大唧社交網絡 對我哋嘅健康非常重要。 
 So I finished. ||| 最後我完成咗， 
 And I kind of went overboard on the week after the project was over. ||| 不過喺計劃後嘅一個星期後， 我變得有啲過火， 
 I went to the dark side, and I just indulged myself. ||| 有啲瘋狂。 我已經過份沉迷。 
 It was like something out of Caligula. ||| 好似係暴君統治下釋放出嚟咁， 
 (Laughter) Without the sex part. ||| （笑聲） 不過唔包括性行為， 
 Because I have three young kids, so that wasn't happening. ||| 因為我屋企有三個小朋友， 所以無乜可能， 
 But the over-eating and over-drinking, definitely. ||| 不過我絕對有暴飲暴食。 
 And I finally have stabilized. ||| 最後我穩定落嚟， 
 So now I'm back to adopting many — not all; I don't wear a helmet anymore — but dozens of healthy behaviors that I adopted during my year. ||| 宜家我回復正常， 當然仲維持住好多 過去一年嘅健康行為， 不過唔包括戴安全帽。 
 It was really a life-changing project. ||| 依個計劃改變咗我嘅生活， 
 And I, of course, don't have time to go into all of them. ||| 我無時間同你哋一一列舉 
 Let me just tell you two really quickly. ||| 等我簡短咁講兩點。 
 The first is — and this was surprising to me; I didn't expect this to come out — but I live a much quieter life now. ||| 第一, 亦係令我好意外， 我無諗過會發生嘅 — 就係我宜家嘅生活更安靜。 
 Because we live in such a noisy world. ||| 我哋生活喺一個好嘈嘅環境， 
 There's trains and planes and cars and Bill O'Reilly, he's very noisy. ||| 火車、飛機同汽車， 仲有比爾·奧萊利，佢都好嘈。 
 (Laughter) And this is a real underestimated, under-appreciated health hazard — not just because it harms our hearing, which it obviously does, but it actually initiates the fight-or-flight response. ||| （笑聲） 好多人都低估咗、忽略依個健康破壞者。 佢好明顯會影響我哋嘅聽力 而且仲會引起 應急反應。 
 A loud noise will get your fight-or-flight response going. ||| 一下好大嘅聲響會引起你嘅應急反應， 
 And this, over the years, can cause real damage, cardiovascular damage. ||| 幾年之後 就會造成真正嘅破壞，例如破壞心血管。 
 The World Health Organization just did a big study that they published this year. ||| 世界衛生組織最近進行做咗一項大研究 今年啱啱發布。 
 And it was done in Europe. ||| 依項研究喺歐洲進行， 
 And they estimated that 1.6 million years of healthy living are lost every year in Europe because of noise pollution. ||| 佢哋估計 每年歐洲因為噪音污染， 一百六十萬年既 健康生活會消失。 
 So they think it's actually very deadly. ||| 所以佢哋認為噪音可以致命。 
 And by the way, it's also terrible for your brain. ||| 另外， 噪音對個腦都唔好， 
 It really impairs cognition. ||| 佢會破壞你嘅知覺。 
 And our Founding Fathers knew about this. ||| 就連美國嘅“建國之父”都知道， 
 When they wrote the Constitution, they put dirt all over the cobblestones outside the hall so that they could concentrate. ||| 當佢哋撰寫《美國憲法》嘅時候道， 佢哋喺大堂外嘅石卵上鋪滿泥土減噪道， 等佢哋可以專心撰寫。 
 So without noise reduction technology, our country would not exist. ||| 所以，如果無減噪技術， 美國可能唔存在。 
 So as a patriot, I felt it was important to — I wear all the earplugs and the earphones, and it's really improved my life in a surprising and unexpected way. ||| 作為一個愛國者， 我覺得戴耳塞同護耳耳機 非常重要， 而且佢仲好意外咁 改善我嘅生活。 
 And the second point I want to make, the final point, is that — and it's actually been a theme of TEDMED — that joy is so important to your health, that very few of these behaviors will stick with me unless there's some sense of pleasure and joy in them. ||| 第二點，亦都喺最後一樣我想要講嘅 依個亦係 TEDMED 嘅主題 就係快樂對於健康好重要， 正如我維持咗好少健康行為 除非佢哋 會令我覺得開心。 
 And just to give you one instance of this: food. ||| 舉一個例子： 食物。 
 The junk food industry is really great at pressing our pleasure buttons and figuring out what's the most pleasurable. ||| 垃圾食物行業 係非常擅於 激起我哋嘅快樂感覺， 同埋知道咩可以令我哋最開心。 
 But I think we can use their techniques and apply them to healthy food. ||| 但我認為我哋可以將佢哋嘅技巧 利用喺健康食物之上。 
 To give just one example, we love crunchiness, mouthfeel. ||| 譬如話 我哋好喜歡脆口、有口感嘅嘢， 
 So I basically have tried to incorporate crunchiness into a lot of my recipes — throw in some sunflower seeds. ||| 所以我嘗試將香脆口感 融入我嘅食譜 例如放啲瓜子。 
 And you can almost trick yourself into thinking you're eating Doritos. ||| 可能你會以為 自己食緊粟米片。 
 (Laughter) And it has made me a healthier person. ||| （笑聲） 咁食法仲可以令我變得更健康。 
 So that is it. ||| 就喺咁。 
 The book about it comes out in April. ||| 依個計劃嘅書會喺4月出版， 
 "It's called ""Drop Dead Healthy."" And I hope that I don't get sick during the book tour." ||| 叫做《Drop Dead Healthy》。 我希望喺新書宣傳途中唔會病倒， 
 That's my greatest hope. ||| 呢個我最大嘅願望係,。 
 So thank you very much. ||| 多謝各位！ 
 (Applause) ||| （掌聲） 
 (Music) (Music) (Applause) (Applause) ||| （音樂） （音樂）（鼓掌） （鼓掌） 
 It's really a failure to detect a certain kind of danger. ||| 當呢個錯覺嚟嗰陣 
 And yet rather than be scared, most of you will feel that what I'm talking about is kind of cool. ||| 你哋可能唔覺得我依家講緊嘅嘢恐怖 反而覺得好型 
 And yet if you're anything like me, you'll find that it's fun to think about these things. ||| 依家你哋或者同我一樣 覺得諗呢啲嘢好得意 
 And that response is part of the problem. ||| 正因為覺得得意 
 This is a winner-take-all scenario. ||| 喺呢場人工智能較量中有六個月嘅優勢 
 But I'm not a climate scientist, I'm an astronomer. ||| 不過我唔係氣候學家，我係天文學家 
 Indeed, it's possible that Mars was habitable in the past, and in part, this is why we study Mars so much. ||| 其實以前，火星的確有可能宜居 呢個亦係我哋深入研究火星嘅原因 
 The extreme environments of our own world are alien vistas. ||| 我哋呢個世界嘅極端環境 其實等如外星嘅美景 
 Joe Kowan: I have stage fright. ||| 我好驚上台 
 And it didn't even matter until I was 27. ||| 27歲以前都唔覺得有咩問題 
 Just knowing my roommates were in the  same house made me uncomfortable. ||| 如果室友喺度，我就會就身唔自在 
 But after a couple of years,  just writing songs wasn't enough. ||| 但寫咗歌幾年，發覺仲未夠 
 I had all these stories and ideas, and I wanted to share them with people, but physiologically, I couldn't do it. ||| 我想將我嘅故事同想法話俾其他人知 但我生理上就係做唔到 
 I had this irrational fear. ||| 我有呢種唔合理嘅恐懼 
 But the more I wrote, and the more I practiced, the more I wanted to perform. ||| 但係我越寫得多，練習得越多 我就越想上台表演 
 So on the week of my 30th birthday, I decided I was going to go to this local open mic, and put this fear behind me. ||| 就喺30歲生日嗰個禮拜 我決定去參與呢個表演 同埋先擺低內心嘅恐懼 
 Well, when I got there, it was packed. ||| 去到表演場地，見到爆滿 
 There were like 20 people there. ||| 整整坐咗20人 
 But I took a deep breath, and I signed up to play, and I felt pretty good. ||| 我深呼吸，然後報名上台表演 我當時仲覺得唔錯 
 Pretty good, until about 10 minutes before my turn, when my whole body rebelled, and  this wave of anxiety just washed over me. ||| 直至我上台前十分鐘 身體開始唔聽話，焦慮嘅情緒湧埋嚟 
 Now, when you experience fear,  your sympathetic nervous system kicks in. ||| 當你驚嘅時候，交感神經就會活躍 
 So you have a rush of adrenaline,  your heart rate increases, your breathing gets faster. ||| 腎上腺素急速增加，心跳加快 呼吸變得急促 
 Next your non-essential systems start  to shut down, like digestion. (Laughter) So your mouth gets dry, and blood is routed away from your extremities, so your fingers don't work anymore. ||| 跟住落黎一啲唔重要嘅器官 口會乾，血液由身體盡頭流返去中央 所以你嘅手指唔聽使 
 I mean, your nervous system is an idiot. ||| 其實神經系統好蠢 
 I mean, it's a nightmare. ||| 簡直係一場惡夢 
 It was so bad. ||| 情況壞到極點 
 But that was my first real experience  as a solo singer-songwriter. ||| 但嗰次係我第一次唱住自已寫嘅歌 
 And I wanted more. But I knew  I had to get past this nervousness. ||| 我仲想要更多 
 That night I promised myself:  I would go back every week until I wasn't nervous anymore. ||| 所以嗰晚我決心要毎個禮拜都返去 直到我唔緊張為止 
 And I did. I went back every single week, and sure enough, week after week, it didn't get any better. The same  thing happened every week. (Laughter) I couldn't shake it. ||| 我真嘅每個禮拜都返去表演 雖然每個禮拜都有去 但係情況冇改善。每個禮拜都舊態復發 我仲係咁驚 
 And that's when I had an epiphany. ||| 有一日我突然感悟到啲嘢 
 And I remember it really well, because I  don't have a lot of epiphanies. (Laughter) All I had to do was write a song  that exploits my nervousness. ||| 我好記得呢次感悟，因為我好少會有感悟 其實我只需要寫一首 關於自己恐懼嘅歌就得啦 
 First, fessing up to the problem, the physical manifestations, how I would feel, how the listener might feel. ||| 首歌開頭講我承認我嘅問題 身體反應點樣、我感覺點樣 觀眾感覺點樣 
 And then accounting for things like my shaky voice, and I knew I would be singing about a  half-octave higher than normal, because I was nervous. ||| 跟著描述我顫抖嘅聲音 同埋我知道我到時會唱高半八度 因為我會好緊張 
 ♫ Not to discuss this at length, ♫ ♫ but my body image was never my strength. ♫ ♫ So frankly, I wish that you all would get dressed, ♫ ♫ I mean, you're not even really naked. ♫ ♫ And I'm the one with the problem. ♫ ♫ And you tell me, don't worry  so much, you'll be great. ♫ ♫ But I'm the one living with me ♫ ♫ and I know how I get. ♫ ♫ Your advice is gentle but late. ♫ ♫ If not just a bit patronizing. ♫ ♫ And that sarcastic tone doesn't  help me when I sing. ♫ ||| ♫ 呢樣就唔使多講 ♫ ♫ 但我嘅身體形象 永遠都唔係我嘅長處 ♫ ♫ 真心，我希望你哋都可以著衫 ♫ ♫ 我嘅意思係，你唔係真係赤祼 ♫ ♫ 我係有問題嗰個 ♫ ♫ 你叫我唔使擔心你會表演得好好 ♫ ♫ 但係我只係最終面對自己嘅人 ♫ ♫ 我知道我會點 ♫ ♫ 你嘅說話好好，可惜太遲啦 ♫ ♫ 若果唔係有啲哄騙 ♫ ♫ 諷刺嘅語氣對我嘅表演無補於事 ♫ 
 ♫ But we shouldn't talk about  these things right now, ♫ ♫ really, I'm up on stage, and  you're in the crowd. Hi. ♫ ♫ And I'm not making fun of  unnurtured, irrational fear, ♫ ♫ and if I wasn't ready to face this, ♫ ♫ I sure as hell wouldn't be here. ♫ ♫ But if I belt one note out clearly, ♫ ♫ you'll know I'm recovering slowly but surely. ♫ ♫ And maybe next week, I'll set my guitar ringin' ♫ ♫ my voice clear as water, and everyone singin'. ♫ ♫ But probably I'll just get up and start groovin', ♫ ||| ♫ 不過宜家我哋唔應該討論呢啲嘢 ♫ ♫ 因為講真嘅 我喺台上，你喺台下。你好呀 ♫ ♫ 而且我唔係用恐懼感黎開玩笑 ♫ ♫ 如果我仲未準備好面對佢 ♫ ♫ 我今日就唔會喺度 ♫ ♫ 如果我唱到明亮嘅音符 ♫ ♫ 你就知道我逐漸喺度復原 ♫ ♫ 或者下個禮拜，我會彈吉他 ♫ ♫ 我把聲會好似水咁清 而大家都會一齊唱 ♫ ♫ 但我宜家只想演奏 ♫ 
 Imagine, if you will — a gift. ||| 如果你可以的话，幻想一份礼物 
 I'd like for you to picture it in your mind. ||| 请你在你的脑海里描绘 
 It's not too big — about the size of a golf ball. ||| 不是很大 高尔夫球大小 
 So envision what it looks like all wrapped up. ||| 所以再想象它是包裹起来的 
 But before I show you what's inside, I will tell you, it's going to do incredible things for you. ||| 在我向你展示里面的东西之前 我可以告诉 它会为你做难以置信的事情 
 It will bring all of your family together. ||| 它会让你的家人都聚在一起 
 You will feel loved and appreciated like never before and reconnect with friends and acquaintances you haven't heard from in years. ||| 你前所未有地得到爱，得到欣赏 并跟你多年未见的朋友和熟人重新取得联系 并跟你多年未见的朋友和熟人重新取得联系 
 Adoration and admiration will overwhelm you. ||| 爱慕与崇敬 向你袭来

 I'm here to spread the word about the magnificence of spiders and how much we can learn from them. ||| 我喺度傳播吓呢堆字，就喺 蜘蛛幾勁 同埋，我地點樣喺佢度學幾多嘢。 
 Spiders are truly global citizens. ||| 蜘蛛真喺世界公民。 
 You can find spiders in nearly every terrestrial habitat. ||| 你差唔多可以喺 所有 “陸生生境” 上面揾到蜘蛛。 
 This red dot marks the Great Basin of North America, and I'm involved with an alpine biodiversity project there with some collaborators. ||| 呢個紅點 就喺北美洲大盤地， 同埋我參加的 “高山生物多樣性”的 計劃，喺嗰道我同埋我班同事。 
 Here's one of our field sites, and just to give you a sense of perspective, this little blue smudge here, that's one of my collaborators. ||| 呢一個喺我哋其中一個野外地盤， 比你睇吓喺點嘅樣， 呢，呢個藍色污點嗰度， 佢咪喺我嗰班同事。 
 This is a rugged and barren landscape, yet there are quite a few spiders here. ||| 呢道山勢山窮水惡， 但喺都有幾多蜘蛛嫁。 
 Turning rocks over revealed this crab spider grappling with a beetle. ||| 翻轉舊石頭，睇吓呢隻蟹蛛 同隻甲蟲玩雙撲。 
 Spiders are not just everywhere, but they're extremely diverse. ||| 蜘蛛唔單止周圍都喺， 佢地真喺無處不在。 
 There are over 40,000 described species of spiders. ||| 有記錄都超過四千種 蜘蛛。 
 To put that number into perspective, here's a graph comparing the 40,000 species of spiders to the 400 species of primates. ||| 睇吓嗰個數字， 呢張圖呢四千 種蜘蛛 同400種比較。 
 There are two orders of magnitude more spiders than primates. ||| （蜘蛛）差唔多喺 （靈長類動物）百幾倍 蜘蛛比靈長類多。 
 Spiders are also extremely old. ||| 蜘蛛都幾歷史悠久。 
 On the bottom here, this is the geologic timescale, and the numbers on it indicate millions of years from the present, so the zero here, that would be today. ||| 下面呢度， 呢個喺 ”地質學時標尺度“， 呢個上面嘅數字咪百幾萬 年前囉，呢度喺零， 即喺今日。 
 So what this figure shows is that spiders date back to almost 380 million years. ||| 咁，呢個數字咪喺蜘蛛 可以追溯到差唔多三億八千萬年前。 
 To put that into perspective, this red vertical bar here marks the divergence time of humans from chimpanzees, a mere seven million years ago. ||| 睇吓呢個紅色 直框呢度，咪喺個時間離散度 從猿人進化成人類， 只喺用咗七百萬年。 
 All spiders make silk at some point in their life. ||| 所有蜘蛛都 （吐絲） 喺佢一生某段時間 （吐絲）。 
 Most spiders use copious amounts of silk, and silk is essential to their survival and reproduction. ||| 大部分蜘蛛用大量唔同嘅蜘蛛絲， 同埋蜘蛛絲對佢求生都幾重要 重有繁殖呢。 
 Even fossil spiders can make silk, as we can see from this impression of a spinneret on this fossil spider. ||| 化石蛛都可以做絲 睇吓呢張（圖） 石化蛛同埋佢個蛛絲頭。 
 So this means that both spiders and spider silk have been around for 380 million years. ||| 所以，兩個蜘蛛 同埋蜘蛛絲已經存在 咗三億八千萬年。 
 It doesn't take long from working with spiders to start noticing how essential silk is to just about every aspect of their life. ||| （你）唔使同蜘蛛做太耐嘢 （你）就開始發覺蜘蛛絲點重要 喺佢（蜘蛛）一生各個方面。 
 Spiders use silk for many purposes, including the trailing safety dragline, wrapping eggs for reproduction, protective retreats and catching prey. ||| 蜘蛛用（蜘蛛）絲有好多原因，如 搖曳安全拖絲， 包裹（蜘蛛）蛋以供繁殖， 保護性撤退 同埋獵食 
 There are many kinds of spider silk. ||| 蜘蛛絲有好多種 
 For example, this garden spider can make seven different kinds of silks. ||| 比如，呢個 “園蛛” 可以做 七種唔同嘅蜘蛛絲。 
 When you look at this orb web, you're actually seeing many types of silk fibers. ||| 當你睇呢個環形蜘蛛網時，你其實 睇緊好多種蜘蛛絲纖維。 
 The frame and radii of this web is made up of one type of silk, while the capture spiral is a composite of two different silks: the filament and the sticky droplet. ||| （蜘蛛）網架和（蜘蛛）網半徑架 是由一種蜘蛛絲做， 但補旋網嘅組成 喺由兩種唔同嘅蜘蛛絲： 小絲體同埋粘滴 
 How does an individual spider make so many kinds of silk? ||| 個別蜘蛛點樣 整咁多種蜘蛛絲呢？ 
 To answer that, you have to look a lot closer at the spinneret region of a spider. ||| 要揾答案，你要睇埋啲 蜘蛛嗰個 ”吐絲頭“ 嗰度。 
 "So silk comes out of the spinnerets, and for those of us spider silk biologists, this is what we call the ""business end"" of the spider. (Laughter) We spend long days ..." ||| 蜘蛛絲從 ”吐絲頭“ 嗰度出離，同埋 我哋呢啲蜘蛛絲生物學家，呢啲 我哋叫佢做蜘蛛嘅 “生意”。 （笑聲） 我哋用咗好長日子..... 
 Hey! Don't laugh. That's my life. ||| 嘻，唔好笑，我條命喺咁。 
 (Laughter) We spend long days and nights staring at this part of the spider. ||| （笑聲） 我哋用咗好長嘅日與夜 睇住蜘蛛呢部分， 
 And this is what we see. ||| 同埋呢啲咪喺我睇到嘅嘢。 
 You can see multiple fibers coming out of the spinnerets, because each spinneret has many spigots on it. ||| 你可以睇到好多纖維 從 “吐絲頭” 個度出離，因為 每一個 “吐絲頭” 上面有好多個 “咀”。 
 Each of these silk fibers exits from the spigot, and if you were to trace the fiber back into the spider, what you would find is that each spigot connects to its own individual silk gland. A silk gland kind of looks like a sac with a lot of silk proteins stuck inside. ||| 每個 （蜘蛛）絲纖維喺唔同嘅 “咀” 出離 同埋如果你從纖維追返轉頭 去蜘蛛身體，你會揾到嘅喺 每一個 “咀” 連接住單個嘅 （蜘蛛）絲腺體，絲腺體睇嚟好似一個液囊 同埋好多蛛絲蛋白黐喺裡面。 
 So if you ever have the opportunity to dissect an orb-web-weaving spider, and I hope you do, what you would find is a bounty of beautiful, translucent silk glands. ||| 所有，如果你無機會解剖 環形網織網蜘蛛， 我希望你有機會， 你會揾到一啲 ”好嘢“ 好靚，半透明嘅絲腺體 
 Inside each spider, there are hundreds of silk glands, sometimes thousands. ||| 每隻蜘蛛裡面，有百幾個 絲腺體，有時，成千個。 
 These can be grouped into seven categories. ||| 呢啲可以被組成七類 
 They differ by size, shape, and sometimes even color. ||| 佢地大細，外形唔同， 有時顏色都唔同 
 In an orb-web-weaving spider, you can find seven types of silk glands, and what I have depicted here in this picture, let's start at the one o'clock position, there's tubuliform silk glands, which are used to make the outer silk of an egg sac. ||| 在環形網織網蜘蛛裡面， 你可以揾到七種絲腺體， 同埋我喺呢張圖描述咁， 我哋從 ”一點鐘“ 位置開始， 嗰啲 ”小管狀“ 的絲腺體，佢喺被用嚟 製造液囊體外絲。 
 There's the aggregate and flagelliform silk glands which combine to make the sticky capture spiral of an orb web. ||| 呢度喺聚狀腺絲同埋鞭狀腺絲 各腺體組合成嗰啲好黐嘅 環形蜘蛛網上面螺旋捕捉體。 
 Pyriform silk glands make the attachment cement — that's the silk that's used to adhere silk lines to a substrate. ||| 梨渦狀絲腺體製造嗰啲附加嘅 黐固劑 — 佢喺嗰啲用嚟黐住 （蜘蛛）絲線同埋嗰個底座。 
 There's also aciniform silk, which is used to wrap prey. ||| 嗰啲葡萄串状絲都喺 被用嚟包住獵物。 
 Minor ampullate silk is used in web construction. ||| 小壺腹狀的絲線用嚟起網。 
 And the most studied silk line of them all: major ampullate silk. ||| 同埋所有絲線研究 裡面最多嘅：大壺腹狀絲。 
 This is the silk that's used to make the frame and radii of an orb web, and also the safety trailing dragline. ||| 呢啲（蜘蛛）絲喺用嚟做 （網）架 同埋環形網嗰個網半徑架，重有 嗰條搖曳安全拖丝。 
 But what, exactly, is spider silk? ||| 即喺點，正確啲，蜘蛛絲喺點？ 
 Spider silk is almost entirely protein. ||| 蜘蛛絲差唔多都喺全蛋白質。 
 Nearly all of these proteins can be explained by a single gene family, so this means that the diversity of silk types we see today is encoded by one gene family, so presumably the original spider ancestor made one kind of silk, and over the last 380 million years, that one silk gene has duplicated and then diverged, specialized, over and over and over again, to get the large variety of flavors of spider silks that we have today. ||| 大部分呢啲蛋白質都能夠由 單基因家族解釋， 所以，呢啲不同種類嘅蜘蛛絲 我哋今日睇到都喺由單基因家族所編碼， 因此，可以假設原始蜘蛛祖先 只喺做一種絲 同埋繫最近嘅三億八千萬年前 只是一種 （蜘蛛絲）基因被複製 跟着，被轉绿，特化， 不停，不停，不停地咁樣，產生 大量唔同樣嘅蜘蛛絲 我哋今日個嗰啲 （蜘蛛絲）。 
 There are several features that all these silks have in common. They all have a common design, such as they're all very long — they're sort of outlandishly long compared to other proteins. ||| 所有呢啲都由幾種特性 一樣，佢地都有同樣 式樣，就好似佢地都好長 — 長得有啲古古怪怪 同其他蛋白質比較。 
 They're very repetitive, and they're very rich in the amino acids glycine and alanine. ||| 佢地重重覆覆，同埋好多 氨基酸裡面嘅甘氨酸同丙氨酸。 
 To give you an idea of what a spider silk protein looks like, this is a dragline silk protein, it's just a portion of it, from the black widow spider. ||| 比例一啲印象你睇 蜘蛛絲蛋白喺點樣， 呢條喺拖丝蛋白， 佢喺 （拖絲）其中一部分， 喺由黑寡婦蜘蛛（度攞出嚟）。 
 This is the kind of sequence that I love looking at day and night. (Laughter) So what you're seeing here is the one letter abbreviation for amino acids, and I've colored in the glycines with green, and the alanines in red, and so you can see it's just a lot of G's and A's. ||| "呢類 （蛋白）序列我好鐘意 日日夜夜睇住佢。 （笑聲） 所以，你睇緊呢度嗰個字母 喺氨基酸嘅簡寫，佢比我加咗啲顏色 甘氨酸用綠色， 丙氨酸用紅色，同埋 你能夠睇到佢真喺好多 ”G"" 呀同 “A""呀。" 
 You can also see that there's a lot of short sequence motifs that repeat over and over and over again, so for example there's a lot of what we call polyalanines, or iterated A's, AAAAA. There's GGQ. There's GGY. ||| "加埋你能夠睇到佢又喺好多短嘅 （蛋白）序列圖案，佢地重覆又重覆 重覆又重覆，所以舉例嚟講，嗰度有好多 我哋叫佢做 ”多聚丙氨酸“，或者寫做 ”A's""， AAAAA, 嗰啲 “GGQ"". 嗰啲 ”GGY""." 
 You can think of these short motifs that repeat over and over again as words, and these words occur in sentences. ||| 你諗吓呢啲短嘅圖案 好似文字咁重覆又重覆， 呢啲好似喺句子裡面咁。 
 So for example this would be one sentence, and you would get this sort of green region and the red polyalanine, that repeats over and over and over again, and you can have that hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times within an individual silk molecule. ||| 舉個例，呢度咪一句， 同埋，你會由呢種綠色部分 同埋呢啲紅色嘅 “多聚丙氨酸，佢又重覆 又重覆，不停重覆， 你會見到佢一百又 一百，百幾次咁，喺 一個（蜘蛛）絲分子裡面。 
 Silks made by the same spider can have dramatically different repeat sequences. ||| 同一隻蜘蛛能夠做 顯著不同嘅，重覆嘅（蛋白）序列 
 At the top of the screen, you're seeing the repeat unit from the dragline silk of a garden argiope spider. ||| 喺熒光幕頂上面，你睇緊 嗰啲拖絲體嘅重覆單位 咪喺由 ”園金蛛“ 度攞嚟. 
 It's short. And on the bottom, this is the repeat sequence for the egg case, or tubuliform silk protein, for the exact same spider. And you can see how dramatically different these silk proteins are — so this is sort of the beauty of the diversification of the spider silk gene family. ||| 佢好短，同埋喺下面， 呢啲重覆 （蛋白）序列咪叫做 （蜘蛛）蛋殼，或者叫 ”小管狀“ 絲蛋白， 它都喺來自同一隻蜘蛛。同埋，你能夠見到 幾顯著不同 嘅蛛絲蛋白 — 所以，呢啲咪喺 其中以種靚嘅多元化 嘅蜘蛛絲基因家族。 
 You can see that the repeat units differ in length. They also differ in sequence. ||| 你能夠睇見佢單位間不同 長度，同埋佢地（蛋白）序列不同。 
 So I've colored in the glycines again in green, alanine in red, and the serines, the letter S, in purple. And you can see that the top repeat unit can be explained almost entirely by green and red, and the bottom repeat unit has a substantial amount of purple. ||| 而家，我再喺 ”甘氨酸“ 嗰度填上顏色 填綠色， 丙氨酸填紅色， 絲氨酸 大楷 S ，填紫色。咁樣，你能夠見到 上面嗰啲重覆嘅單位，被解釋到 差唔多全部綠色，紅色， 同埋下面嘅重覆單位咪 好多紫色。 
 What silk biologists do is we try to relate these sequences, these amino acid sequences, to the mechanical properties of the silk fibers. ||| 我哋生物學家咁樣做喺嘗試聯繫 呢啲（蛋白）序列，氨基酸 序列有咩嘢機械特性 出現喺（蜘蛛）絲纖維度。 
 Now, it's really convenient that spiders use their silk completely outside their body. ||| 家吓，真喺好方便，蜘蛛將佢啲絲 全部用喺身體出面 
 This makes testing spider silk really, really easy to do in the laboratory, because we're actually, you know, testing it in air that's exactly the environment that spiders are using their silk proteins. ||| 咁樣，測試蜘蛛絲真喺，真喺 喺實驗室度好簡單，只不過 你哋知唔知我哋喺喺空氣中測試 同實際環境一模一樣 蜘蛛點樣使用佢地啲絲蛋白。 
 So this makes quantifying silk properties by methods such as tensile testing, which is basically, you know, tugging on one end of the fiber, very amenable. ||| 咁樣，咪要用方法量化 （蜘蛛）絲特性 如延展性， 延展性基本上 （你知啦），拉著纖維個頭 佢好貼服 
 Here are stress-strain curves generated by tensile testing five fibers made by the same spider. ||| 呢個 “張力延展” 曲線 由延展性測試產生 嗰五條纖維喺由同樣隻蜘蛛製造 
 So what you can see here is that the five fibers have different behaviors. ||| 咁，你喺度見到就喺 五種纖維有唔同行為特性 
 Specifically, if you look on the vertical axis, that's stress. If you look at the maximum stress value for each of these fibers, you can see that there's a lot of variation, and in fact dragline, or major ampullate silk, is the strongest of these fibers. ||| 具體啲，你睇吓條縱軸， 嗰個壓逼力。如果你睇 呢啲纖維嘅最大 “壓逼” 值。 你就睇到真喺好多種變化， 事實上，“拖絲” 或者 “壺腹狀絲”， 喺呢啲纖維裡面最 “勁” 嘅。 
 We think that's because the dragline silk, which is used to make the frame and radii for a web, needs to be very strong. ||| 我哋諗，因為“拖絲” 喺用嚟做 （蜘蛛）網架同網半徑架 所有要好 “勁”。 
 On the other hand, if you were to look at strain — this is how much a fiber can be extended — if you look at the maximum value here, again, there's a lot of variation and the clear winner is flagelliform, or the capture spiral filament. ||| 另一方面，如果你睇 延展力 — 呢個咪喺纖維可以 拉幾長 — 如果你睇著個最大數值 呢度，又喺好多可能 好清楚，鞭毛狀 （絲）勝出， 或者，捕旋小絲都喺 
 In fact, this flagelliform fiber can actually stretch over twice its original length. ||| 實際上，呢個鞭毛狀纖維可以 真喺拉長超過佢原先兩倍幾。 
 So silk fibers vary in their strength and also their extensibility. ||| 咁樣，絲纖維改變佢嘅強度 同埋佢嘅伸展能力。 
 In the case of the capture spiral, it needs to be so stretchy to absorb the impact of flying prey. ||| 喺捕旋情況下， 佢要能夠好有延展力去吸收 飛行獵物嘅衝擊。 
 If it wasn't able to stretch so much, then basically when an insect hit the web, it would just trampoline right off of it. ||| "如果，佢唔能夠 “經""伸延， 咁樣，當昆蟲撞埋蜘蛛網嗰陣， 咪會彈翻出去。" 
 So if the web was made entirely out of dragline silk, an insect is very likely to just bounce right off. But by having really, really stretchy capture spiral silk, the web is actually able to absorb the impact of that intercepted prey. ||| 如果，蜘蛛網都喺用 “拖絲”所做，昆蟲咪成日比佢 彈出去。但喺，如果真喺用 延展捕旋絲，個網咪 有能力吸收衝擊 捕著獵物 
 There's quite a bit of variation within the fibers that an individual spider can make. ||| 個別蜘蛛能夠做 好多種唔同嘅（蜘蛛絲）纖維 
 We call that the tool kit of a spider. ||| 我哋叫佢做蜘蛛 ”工具箱“。 
 That's what the spider has to interact with their environment. ||| 呢啲咪蜘蛛點樣 同環境相互反應 
 But how about variation among spider species, so looking at one type of silk and looking at different species of spiders? ||| 但喺，蜘蛛種類之間 點呢，睇吓唔同蜘蛛 但同一種類嘅（蜘蛛）絲？ 
 This is an area that's largely unexplored but here's a little bit of data I can show you. ||| 呢個地方，好大情度未探討過 但喺，我喺度有啲數據可以比你睇。 
 This is the comparison of the toughness of the dragline spilk spun by 21 species of spiders. ||| 呢度比較有關 21 種唔同嘅 蜘蛛所吐嘅絲 
 Some of them are orb-weaving spiders and some of them are non-orb-weaving spiders. ||| 有啲喺環形網蛛 有啲唔喺環形網蛛 
 It's been hypothesized that orb-weaving spiders, like this argiope here, should have the toughest dragline silks because they must intercept flying prey. ||| 曾經假設過 環形網蛛好似 “金珠” 咁 都擁有特高韌性拖線絲 因為，佢地一定要捕捉飛行獵物。 
 What you see here on this toughness graph is the higher the black dot is on the graph, the higher the toughness. ||| 呢度你睇吓個韌性圖 圖上面黑點越高 代表韌性越高 
 The 21 species are indicated here by this phylogeny, this evolutionary tree, that shows their genetic relationships, and I've colored in yellow the orb-web-weaving spiders. ||| 呢度表明咗 21 種蜘蛛嘅 發展史，進化樹圖，說明咗 佢地嘅基因關係，我填咗 黃色咪喺環形網蛛。 
 If you look right here at the two red arrows, they point to the toughness values for the draglines of nephila clavipes and araneus diadematus. ||| 你睇紅箭咀呢度 佢指住個韌性值 咪喺絡新婦蛛同埋 十字園蛛嗰啰。 
 These are the two species of spiders for which the vast majority of time and money on synthetic spider silk research has been to replicate their dragline silk proteins. ||| 佢地喺兩種蜘蛛 已經花咗大量時間同金錢 研究點樣合成嘅蜘蛛絲 去覆製佢地嘅 ”拖線“絲蛋白。 
 Yet, their draglines are not the toughest. ||| 家吓，嗰啲 ”拖線絲“ 唔喺最韌嘅 
 In fact, the toughest dragline in this survey is this one right here in this white region, a non orb-web-weaving spider. ||| 事實上，呢個調查最韌嘅”拖線絲“ 喺白色呢度右邊嗰部分， 一啲環形網蛛嘅。 
 This is the dragline spun by scytodes, the spitting spider. ||| 呢條拖線由 ”花皮“ 蜘蛛所吐。 
 Scytodes doesn't use a web at all to catch prey. Instead, scytodes sort of lurks around and waits for prey to get close to it, and then immobilizes prey by spraying a silk-like venom onto that insect. ||| ”花皮“ 蜘蛛根本唔用網 嚟捕食。”花皮“ 蜘蛛 用一種潜伏一旁，等待獵物 慢慢走近獵物，然後使佢唔郁得 噴啲好似絲嘅毒液喺昆蟲上面 
 Think of hunting with silly string. ||| 點樣用絲線捕獵。 
 That's how scytodes forages. ||| 咪好似“ 花皮牧草蛛” 咁。 
 We don't really know why scytodes needs such a tough dragline, but it's unexpected results like this that make bio-prospecting so exciting and worthwhile. ||| "我哋唔知點解 ""花皮蛛” 需要咁韌嘅”拖線絲“ 呢的不尋常結果引起 生物勘探嘅刺激同價值。" 
 It frees us from the constraints of our imagination. ||| 佢釋放我們 幻想上嘅限制 
 Now I'm going to mark on the toughness values for nylon fiber, bombyx — or domesticated silkworm silk — wool, Kevlar, and carbon fibers. ||| 而家，我準備標誌 尼龍纖維嘅最韌值 家蠶蛾属 — 或者家居蠶蟲絲 — 羊毛，克維拉（Kevlar），炭纖維。 
 And what you can see is that nearly all the spider draglines surpass them. ||| 你可以見到差唔多 所有蜘蛛 “拖線”絲都比佢韌 
 It's the combination of strength, extensibility and toughness that makes spider silk so special, and that has attracted the attention of biomimeticists, so people that turn to nature to try to find new solutions. ||| 它柔合了強度，延展度 同埋韌度，使到蜘蛛絲咁 特別，咁吸引 仿生學家嘅注意，因此，人們 從大自然尋找解决方法。 
 And the strength, extensibility and toughness of spider silks combined with the fact that silks do not elicit an immune response, have attracted a lot of interest in the use of spider silks in biomedical applications, for example, as a component of artificial tendons, for serving as guides to regrow nerves, and for scaffolds for tissue growth. ||| 蜘蛛絲嘅強度，延展度，同埋韌度 嘅組合有個事實就喺 蜘蛛絲唔會引致免疫反應 有關大量興趣便是點樣 在生化學上應用蜘蛛絲 例如，作為組成 人工筋肌，服務於引導出 神經再生之法， 支架出組織生長。 
 Spider silks also have a lot of potential for their anti-ballistic capabilities. ||| 蜘蛛絲也有大量可能的 抗彈道能力 
 Silks could be incorporated into body and equipment armor that would be more lightweight and flexible than any armor available today. ||| （蜘蛛）絲有能力和人體結合 同埋冑甲配備便會 重量更輕，更柔韌 好過今日可用的冑甲 
 In addition to these biomimetic applications of spider silks, personally, I find studying spider silks just fascinating in and of itself. ||| 另外，好似蜘蛛絲仿生學 上應用一樣， 我咁講，我研究蜘蛛絲 唔止陶醉咁簡單 
 I love when I'm in the laboratory, a new spider silk sequence comes in. ||| 當我喺實驗室嗰時，我好鍾意 一啲新嘅蜘蛛絲序列入嚟。 
 That's just the best. (Laughter) It's like the spiders are sharing an ancient secret with me, and that's why I'm going to spend the rest of my life studying spider silk. ||| 最好咁樣。 （笑聲） 佢 （蜘蛛）好似同我分享 一個遠古秘密，我因此 會用我的餘生 研究蜘蛛絲 
 The next time you see a spider web, please, pause and look a little closer. ||| 下次，當你見到蜘蛛網時， 唔該，停一停，睇埋啲 
 You'll be seeing one of the most high-performance materials known to man. ||| 你會見到一種人們 了解嘅高性能材料。 
 To borrow from the writings of a spider named Charlotte, silk is terrific. ||| 借用文獻上有一隻 叫 “ 夏洛特” 的蜘蛛說， （蜘蛛）絲是偉大的。 
 Thank you. (Applause) (Applause) ||| 謝謝 （鼓掌） （鼓掌） 
 Well, I'm involved in other things, besides physics. ||| 其實，除咗物理之外，我都參與咗一些其他嘅領域。 
 In fact, mostly now in other things. ||| 事實上，最近我嘅大部分時間都係度做哩地“其他事” 
 One thing is distant relationships among human languages. ||| 其中一件就是關於人類語言的距離關係。 
 And the professional, historical linguists in the U.S. ||| 美國以及西歐國家的職業歷史語言學者 
 and in Western Europe mostly try to stay away from any long-distance relationships, big groupings, groupings that go back a long time, longer than the familiar families. ||| 都試圖逃避 任何關於長距離聯繫（嘅研究）；大族群之間嘅、 那些可以追溯到很久遠、 比目前知道熟悉嘅族群都更古老的族群（嘅研究）。 
 They don't like that. They think it's crank. I don't think it's crank. ||| 距地唔中意研究哩地嘢，覺得哩地係好奇怪嘅嘢，但係我就唔係好認同。 
 And there are some brilliant linguists, mostly Russians, who are working on that, at Santa Fe Institute and in Moscow, and I would love to see where that leads. ||| 有些非常優秀嘅語言學家，其中大多係俄羅斯人， 距地係莫斯科嘅聖塔菲研究院研究哩個課題 我一路都好期待知道哩個研究可以發展到邊。 
 Does it really lead to a single ancestor some 20, 25,000 years ago? ||| 現代語言會唔會真係指向一個2萬或者2萬5千年前 一個共同嘅原始語言？ 
 And what if we go back beyond that single ancestor, when there was presumably a competition among many languages? ||| 又或者，如果我們繼續追溯到哩個原始語言之前又會點樣呢？ 當時大概有多種語言在相互競爭吧。 
 How far back does that go? How far back does modern language go? ||| 甘哩嘀係响幾耐之前呢？近代語言可以追溯到幾耐之前？ 
 How many tens of thousands of years does it go back? ||| 係幾萬年前？ 
 Chris Anderson: Do you have a hunch or a hope for what the answer to that is? ||| Chris Anderson: 你有冇預感或者希望這個問題嘅答案會係咩呢？ 
 Murray Gell-Mann: Well, I would guess that modern language must be older than the cave paintings and cave engravings and cave sculptures and dance steps in the soft clay in the caves in Western Europe, in the Aurignacian Period some 35,000 years ago, or earlier. ||| Murray Gell-Mann: 嗯，我會估現代語言（的起源）大概會比我們（想像的）更加古老 （距應該）比洞穴中嘅壁畫、雕刻、雕塑 或者西歐洞穴中軟泥上嘅舞步-係3萬5千年前嘅歐里納克時期-都要更早 或者西歐洞穴中軟泥上嘅舞步-係3萬5千年前嘅歐里納克時期-都要更早 
 I can't believe they did all those things and didn't also have a modern language. ||| 我好難相信距地可以做到所有哩地事，但係卻冇現代語言。 
 So, I would guess that the actual origin goes back at least that far and maybe further. ||| 所以我會估現代語言嘅真實起源至少可以追溯到果個時候，甚至更遠。 
 But that doesn't mean that all, or many, or most of today's attested languages couldn't descend perhaps from one that's much younger than that, like say 20,000 years, or something of that kind. It's what we call a bottleneck. ||| 但哩個並唔代表所有、許多或者大多數 在今日確認嘅語言 唔會起源於更加後生的淵源，比如20000年前左右 哩個就係我們（在研究哩個問題時）所謂嘅瓶頸。 
 CA: Well, Philip Anderson may have been right. ||| CA: 好啦，Philip Anderson可能真係啱嘅 
 You may just know more about everything than anyone. ||| 你真係在每件事上都比任何人知道更多。 
 So, it's been an honor. Thank you Murray Gell-Mann. ||| 所以好榮幸（可以請到你過來）。多謝你 
 (Applause) ||| （掌聲） 
 You saw the quality of the educators who were here. ||| 我哋嘅師資質素係點，你都有眼見㗎啦 
 Why haven't we fixed this? ||| 噉點解我哋仲未去解決哩個問題呢？ 
 And you know something about a lousy school? ||| 你知道差嘅學校係點樣嘅呢？ 
 It's not like a bottle of wine. ||| 佢唔同一支紅酒，紅酒越耐越好 
 Right? (Laughter) Where you say, like, '87 was like a good year, right? ||| （笑聲） 紅酒黎講，你會話 
 That's now how this thing — I mean, every single year, it's still the same approach, right? ||| 哩啲學校就係噉，噉多年黎 仲係用緊同樣嘅教學方法 
 Do not tell me we can't do better than this. ||| 唔好講我哋唔可以做得更好 
 Banks used to open and operate between 10 and 3. ||| 舊時，銀行朝早 10 點到晏晝 3 點營業 
 They operated 10 to 3. They were closed for lunch hour. ||| 朝早 10 點到晏晝 3 點 
 Now, who can bank between 10 and 3? The unemployed. ||| 噉邊個喺朝早 10 點 到晏晝 3 點哩段時間去銀行？ 
 They don't need banks. They got no money in the banks. ||| 但係佢哋都唔需要去銀行 因為佢哋都無錢 
 Who created that business model? Right? ||| 究竟係邊個創造噉嘅運作模式嘎？ 
 And it went on for decades. ||| 但係佢都運作咗幾十年喎 
 You know why? Because they didn't care. ||| 你知點解嘛？因為佢哋唔在乎 
 It wasn't about the customers. ||| 佢哋眼中冇顧客 
 It was about bankers. They created something that worked for them. ||| 眼中只有銀行家 
 Now, one day, some crazy banker had an idea. ||| 有一日，有個銀行家忽發奇想 
 Maybe we should keep the bank open when people come home from work. ||| 可能我哋應該喺啲人 唔使返工嗰日都營業 
 They might like that. What about a Saturday? ||| 啲人可能鐘意呢。就例如，星期六噉？ 
 "So I was a little slow, and I did not trust technology, and when they first came out with those new contraptions, these tellers that you put in a card and they give you money, I was like, ""There's no way that machine is going to count that money right." ||| 以前我係有啲落後，同埋唔多信科技 所以當佢哋推出嗰啲新嘢嘅時候 嗰啲叫你放張銀行卡入去 就會有錢出黎嘅櫃員機 我就諗︰「部機邊識數錢啊？ 
 Yet not in education. Why? ||| 但係教育無變過。點解？ 
 They will say the worst things about you. ||| 佢哋會講你好多壞話 
 You look at them in September, they've gone down. ||| 但係你九月份再睇 
 (Laughter) Every 10 years they reproduce the same study. ||| （笑聲） 每過十年佢哋都得出同樣嘅研究發現 
 For years I went to — Look, I went the Harvard Ed School. ||| 我響哈佛畢業 
 So who came up with this idea? Who owns it? ||| 所以，係邊個嘅主意呢？ 
 Why did we ever do it? ||| 點解我哋會噉做呢？ 
 Well it just turns out in the 1840s we did have, schools were open all year. They were open all year, because we had a lot of folks who had to work all day. ||| 其實起十九世紀四十年代 當時嘅學校係全年開放嘅，係全年 因為嗰陣好多人每日要工作好多個小時 
 Because our business has refused to use science. ||| 因為我哋教育界拒絕科學 
 "Science. You have Bill Gates coming out and saying, "Look, this works, right? We can do this."" ||| 雖然比爾蓋茨企出黎講︰ 「噉做係得嘅，所以我哋可以做。」 
 How many places in America are going to change? None. ||| 但美國有幾多個地方會做？一個都無 
 None. Okay, yeah, there are two. All right? ||| 一個都無。噢係喔，仲有兩個 
 Yes, there'll be some place, because some folks will do the right thing. ||| 總會有一啲地方，有啲人會做正確嘅事 
 Here's what we know. ||| 而我哋所知嘅就係，問題經已發生 
 My wife, Yvonne, and I, we have four kids, three grown ones and a 15-year-old. ||| 我老婆同我有四個細路 三個已經長大成人，一個 15 歲 
 That's a longer story. ||| 關於我哋嘅事，講就有排講嘞 
 We didn't know how critical those first three years were. ||| 我哋當時仲未知嬰兒頭三年有幾緊要 
 We didn't know what was happening in those young brains. ||| 亦唔知佢哋嘅大腦係點樣一步步發育 
 We know that now. What are we doing about it? Nothing. ||| 當然宜家我哋人人都知道嘞 
 Wealthy people know. Educated people know. ||| 有錢人知道，受過教育嘅人都知道 
 Nope. Lots of places, it doesn't exist. ||| 但係好多地方偏係冇學前班 
 We know health services matter. ||| 我哋知道公共醫療服務不可忽視 
 I used to make stuff up. Right? ||| 我成日都亂作一通 
 But now I'm older, and you know what I tell them? ||| 但係宜家我老啦，你知我點答佢哋嘛？ 
 You know when we're going to get the results back? ||| 但你知我哋會起幾時知道考試結果？ 
 Maybe July, maybe June. ||| 可能七月份，亦都可能係六月份 
 And the results have great data. ||| 考試嘅結果將會包含好多資料 
 They'll tell you Raheem really struggled, couldn't do two-digit multiplication — so great data, but you're getting it back after school is over. ||| 啲資料可能會表明學生 阿 Raheem 嘅成績唔多理想 唔識做兩位數嘅乘法，總之好多資料 但係你得到資料嘅時候學校已經放假嘞 
 You go on vacation. (Laughter) You come back from vacation. ||| 你放假囉。（笑聲） 好嘞，到你放假返黎嘅時候 
 You don't look at it. ||| 但係你唔會去睇佢 
 Why would you look at it? ||| 點解呢？ 
 So how much money did we just spend on all of that? ||| 噉樣我哋咪浪費咗好多錢 起哩啲測驗上邊！ 
 I need that data in November. ||| 我十一月份需要哩啲學習進度報告 
 I can predict school scores. ||| 我可以預測學校嘅成績 
 You take me to any school. ||| 你帶我去任何一間學校 
 I'm really good at inner city schools that are struggling. ||| 我對嗰啲內城資質比較差 但努力緊嘅學校特別在行 
 So we're spending all of this money, but we're getting what? ||| 我哋用咗咁多錢起教育上 我哋得到咗乜嘢呢？ 
 They get angry if you do something different. ||| 你唔跟大隊，佢哋就嬲 
 "If you try something new, people are always like, ""Ooh, charter schools."" Hey, let's try some stuff. Let's see." ||| 當你想嘗試新嘢嘅時候 啲人就會話︰「哇。特許學校喔！」 
 "You know, people tell me, ""Yeah, those charter schools, a lot of them don't work."" A lot of them don't. They should be closed." ||| 有人同我講︰「嗰啲特許學校 好多都唔掂。」 的確係，而且唔應該再繼續落去 
 If you think about technology, imagine if that's how we thought about technology. ||| 就好似技術噉 想像下如果我哋噉樣對待新技術 
 "Every time something didn't work, we just threw in the towel and said, ""Let's forget it."" Right?" ||| 每一次新科技失敗 我哋就認輸，「算啦。」噉啱唔啱呢？ 
 I was so disgusted I spent my money on this thing. ||| 我好後悔浪費咗噉多錢買哩部嘢 
 Did anybody stop inventing? Not a person. Not a soul. ||| 但係啲人就會停止發明咩？ 
 The folks went out there. They kept inventing. ||| 佢哋仲係繼續發明新嘅嘢 
 Our job as educators, there's some stuff we know that we can do. ||| 我哋作為教育工作者 有啲嘢我哋知道我哋係可以做到嘅 
 And we've got to do better. The evaluation, we have to start with kids earlier, we have to make sure that we provide the support to young people. ||| 同埋我哋應該做得更好 我哋要確保提供足夠嘅支援畀年輕人 
 We've got to give them all of these opportunities. ||| 我哋要盡可能畀佢哋機會 
 America cannot wait another 50 years to get this right. ||| 我哋美國唔可以再等上 50 年再黎改革嘞 
 We have run out of time. ||| 我哋已經無時間嘞 
 How many trillions? (Applause) When the country cares about something, we'll spend a trillion dollars without blinking an eye. ||| 幾多萬億？（掌聲） 當一個國家重視一樣嘢嘅時候 即使用一萬億都唔會眨眼 
 Thank you all very much. Thank you. ||| 多謝。好多謝你哋 
 (Applause) John Legend: So what is the high school dropout rate at Harlem Children's Zone? ||| （掌聲） 主持︰喺 Harlem 兒童區入面 中學生嘅輟學率係幾多呢？ 
 Last I heard we had 93 percent accepted to college. ||| 聽講當中有 93% 俾大學錄取 
 We'd better get that other seven percent. ||| 另外 7% 我哋仲要努力 
 "They harass you, right? They call you, they say, ""I want to see your grades. How'd you do on that last test?" ||| 你要去煩住佢哋，同佢哋講 「我想睇下你啲成績喔。 上次個測驗你做成點啊？ 
 Over nearly all of Earth's history, threats have come from nature — disease, earthquakes, asteroids and so forth — but from now on, the worst dangers come from us. ||| 睇返地球歷史 威脅絕大部分都係嚟自大自然 疾病、地震、隕石撞擊等等 但係由宜家開始 最大嘅威脅嚟自於我哋自己 
 The worst have thankfully not yet happened. ||| 好彩最壞嘅仲未發生 
 Indeed, they probably won't. ||| 確實，佢哋應該唔會發生 
 We get ever more vulnerable. ||| 我哋於是更加經唔起考驗 
 Well, can we guard against such risks by regulation? ||| 噉，我哋可以通過規管 去避免呢啲危機嗎？ 
 It's like the drug laws — we try to regulate, but can't. ||| 就好似禁毒法律咁 我哋去監管，但始終失敗 
 Scenario A wipes out 90 percent of humanity. ||| 場景一，消滅 90% 人類 
 Scenario B wipes out 100 percent. ||| 場景二，消滅所有人類 
 How much worse is B than A? ||| 場景二比場景一壞幾多呢？ 
 Some would say 10 percent worse. ||| 有人會話差十個百分點 
 The body count is 10 percent higher. ||| 死亡統計係高出十個百分點 
 But I claim that B is incomparably worse. ||| 但係我唔會話場景二比較差 
 And so let's not jeopardize that future. ||| 我哋唔要糟塌呢個星球嘅未來 
 We're not talking each other. We're facing forward. ||| 大家冇傾偈，大家都係向前行 
 We're going to do working memory today. ||| 我哋今日講工作記憶 
 It's not something we can turn off. ||| 我哋唔會熄到佢 
 If you turn it off, that's called a coma, okay? ||| 如果你真係要熄咗佢，你就會昏迷 
 So right now, you're doing just fine. ||| 所以呢，你哋宜家都冇熄咗佢 
 Now working memory has four basic components. ||| 工作記憶有四個基本元素 
 It allows us to store some immediate experiences and a little bit of knowledge. ||| 佢可以儲存上一秒嘅經歷 同埋少少知識 
 It's more mundane. I'd like that cookie, or I need to figure out how to get into my hotel room. ||| 而係比較日常，就好似我要嗰塊餅 或者我要諗方法入去酒店房間 
 They're able to have high levels of writing ability. ||| 佢哋嘅寫作能力都好高 
 They're also able to reason at high levels. ||| 推理水平都好高 
 So what we're going to do here is play a little bit with some of that. ||| 咁宜家，我哋就嚟玩一個 工作記憶容量嘅遊戲 
 So I'm going to ask you to perform a couple tasks, and we're going to take your  working memory out for a ride. ||| 我會叫你哋做一啲任務 你哋就要用你哋嘅工作記憶 
 You up for that? Okay. ||| 你哋準備好未？ 
 Don't write them down. Just hang on to them. ||| 唔要寫落嚟，只可以用腦記住 
 While you're hanging on to them, I'm going to ask you to answer three questions. ||| 你哋記住嘅同時，要答我三個問題 
 I want to see what happens with those words. ||| 我想睇下你哋嘅記憶係點 
 So here's the words: tree, highway, mirror, Saturn and electrode. ||| 好，呢五個字係： 樹 公路 鏡 土星 電極 
 So far so good? ||| 冇問題呀嗎？ 
 (Laughter) All right. How many people here are still pretty sure you've got all five words? ||| （笑聲） 好。宜家有幾多人 仲記得我頭先講嗰五個字？ 
 Okay. Typically we end up with about less than half, right, which is normal. There will be a range. ||| 好。通常唔到一半嘅人仲記得 冇錯，呢個好正常。因人而異 
 Some people can hang on to five. ||| 有啲人可以記到五個 
 Some people can hang on to 10. ||| 有啲人可以記到十個 
 Some will be down to two or three. ||| 有啲人剩係記到兩三個 
 What we know is this is really important to the way we function, right? ||| 我哋知道，工作記憶 對大腦嘅運作好重要，係嗎？ 
 And it's going to be really important here at TED because you're going to be exposed to so many different ideas. ||| 喺 TED 呢度尤其重要 因為你會聽到好多嘅諗法 
 But it does have certain limits. ||| 佢雖然有限制 
 Now working memory is great for allowing us to communicate. ||| 但工作記憶可以令我哋同人溝通 
 We can have a conversation, and I can build a narrative around that so I know where we've been and where we're going and how to contribute to this conversation. ||| 令我哋可以同人傾偈 令我知道我哋講梗啲乜嘢 要講啲乜嘢 同埋點樣令個討論更加好 
 It allows us to problem-solve, critical think. ||| 工作記憶令我哋解決問題 
 All of that occurs within working memory. ||| 呢啲嘢都係由工作記憶完成 
 Now, a central issue with working memory is that it's limited. ||| 工作記憶有佢嘅局限 呢樣亦都係佢嘅核心問題 
 We tend to remember about four things. ||| 我哋一般可以記到四樣嘢 
 When we think about working memory, we have to realize that this limited capacity has lots of different impacts on us. ||| 我哋睇工作記憶 我哋必須認清佢容量係有限 所以佢對我哋會有好多影響 
 Have you ever walked from one room to another and then forgotten why you're there? ||| 你有冇試過由一個房行到另一間 但你唔記得咗點解要行過嚟？ 
 You do know the solution to that, right? ||| 你知道點做，係咪？ 
 You ever forgotten your car? ||| 你有冇唔記得架車喺邊？ 
 You ever forgotten your kids? ||| 有冇唔記得咗細路？ 
 We negotiate that through strategies. ||| 我哋可以用一啲方法 
 So we need to think about, well, do I agree with him? ||| 我哋即時要諗嘅包括︰我同意佢嗎？ 
 What's missing? What would I like to know? ||| 少咗啲咩？我想知道啲咩？ 
 Do I agree with the assumptions? ||| 我同意呢啲假設嗎？ 
 How can I apply this in my life? ||| 可以知道套用到生活？ 
 It's a way of processing what's going on so that we can use it later. ||| 明白目前發生嘅事 我哋就可以有經驗，之後再用得返 
 Practice for some reason became a very negative thing. ||| 「練習」因為某啲原因令人覺得係負面 
 It's very positive. ||| 但佢其實係好正面 
 What we want to do is spin that around. ||| 我哋就想倒轉 
 We need to take advantage of that. ||| 我哋可以善用呢個特點 
 If you read a book, pull things up. ||| 如果你睇梗一本書，就要連埋啲嘢 
 The last one is organization and support. ||| 最後一樣係組織同支援 
 We are meaning-making machines. It's what we do. ||| 人類係會對事物附加意思 
 We all started as novices. ||| 我哋都係由初學者開始 
 Everything we do is an approximation of sophistication. ||| 我哋做嘅每一件事都係朝著複雜進發 
 Now, the final piece of this, the take-home message from a working memory capacity standpoint is this: what we process, we learn. ||| 最後，我想帶出一個重點 喺工作記憶裏面 我哋個腦處理嘅嘢，就係我哋要學嘅嘢 
 If we're not processing life, we're not living it. ||| 假如我哋個腦冇處理過生活大小事情 
 Live life. Thank you. ||| 好好過你嘅生活。多謝 
 (Applause) ||| （掌聲） 
 There's this great piece in The Atlantic. ||| 《大西洋月刊》曾經有篇佳作 
 Number three: Use open-ended questions. ||| 第三：善用開放式問題 
 Number five: If you don't know, say that you don't know. ||| 第五：唔識就話唔識 
 Number six: Don't equate your experience with theirs. ||| 第六：唔好騎劫人哋嘅經歷 
 Thanks. ||| 多謝 
 Phyllis Rodriguez: We are here today because of the fact that we have what most people consider an unusual friendship. ||| 我地今日系哩度 系因为 我地有一份好多人都觉得 不平凡噶友谊。 
 And it is. ||| 而且距的确系咁。 
 And yet, it feels natural to us now. ||| 现在，我地已经觉得好自然了。 
 I first learned that my son had been in the World Trade Center on the morning of September 11th, 2001. ||| 当初知道 我噶仔系2001年9月11日噶早上 入左世贸大楼。 
 We didn't know if he had perished yet until 36 hours later. ||| 直到36个钟后 我地先知道 距已经离开左。 
 At the time, we knew that it was political. ||| 果阵， 我知道同政治有关。 
 We were afraid of what our country was going to do in the name of our son — my husband, Orlando, and I and our family. ||| 我地担心国家会以我地个仔噶名义 去做果D事 我先生，奥兰多同埋我，我地一家人。 
 And when I saw it — and yet, through the shock, the terrible shock, and the terrible explosion in our lives, literally, we were not vengeful. ||| 系我睇到果阵 不过，经历左哩种震惊， 可怕噶震惊， 实质上生命中可怕噶震惊后， 我地并唔想报复。 
 And a couple of weeks later when Zacarias Moussaoui was indicted on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism, and the U.S. government called for a death penalty for him, if convicted, my husband and I spoke out in opposition to that, publicly. ||| 几个星期后 迦利亚·穆萨维受到指控 成为六名策划制造袭击噶恐怖分子之一， 美国政府将对距进行判决死刑， 如果定罪， 我同我先生 都会用完全唔同噶视角，群众噶角度探讨过哩D野。 
 Through that and through human rights groups, we were brought together with several other victims' families. ||| 通过哩D 同埋人权组织， 我地聚合埋一齐 仲有D其他受害者家属。 
 "When I saw Aicha in the media, coming over when her son was indicted, and I thought, ""What a brave woman." ||| 当我系媒体上见艾莎噶时候， 距噶仔受到左指控， 我想：“几咁勇敢噶女人啊。 
 "Someday I want to meet that woman when I'm stronger."" I was still in deep grief; I knew I didn't have the strength." ||| 系我更加强大噶时候，我想见下哩个女人。“ 我仲沉浸于悲伤之中， 我知我唔够坚强。 
 I knew I would find her someday, or we would find each other. ||| 我知终有一日我会稳到距， 或者我地会互相稳到对方。 
 Because, when people heard that my son was a victim, I got immediate sympathy. ||| 因为，系人地听讲我噶仔受害后， 我即刻受到同情。 
 But when people learned what her son was accused of, she didn't get that sympathy. ||| 但系当听到 距噶仔被指控果阵， 距唔受到同情。 
 But her suffering is equal to mine. ||| 不过距同我一样甘痛苦。 
 So we met in November 2002, and Aicha will now tell you how that came about. ||| 跟住我地系2002年11月见面了。 跟住落艾莎会话比你地听 成件事系点噶。 
 (Translator) Aicha el-Wafi: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. ||| （译者）艾莎·瓦非：女士们先生们，下午好。 
 I am the mother of Zacarias Moussaoui. ||| 我系撒迦利亚·穆萨维噶妈咪。 
 And I asked the Organization of Human Rights to put me in touch with the parents of the victims. ||| 我请求 人权组织 比我同果D受害者家属联系。 
 So they introduced me to five families. ||| 于是距地就将我介绍比 5个家庭。 
 And I saw Phyllis, and I watched her. ||| 当我见到菲莉斯果阵，我注意到距。 
 She was the only mother in the group. ||| 距系哩个团体中唯一噶妈妈。 
 The others were brothers, sisters. ||| 其他都系兄弟姐妹。 
 And I saw in her eyes that she was a mother, just like me. ||| 我从距噶眼神睇出 距系一位妈咪，同我一样。 
 I suffered a lot as a mother. ||| 作为一个妈咪我都受到好多惨痛经历。 
 I was married when I was 14. ||| 我14岁结婚。 
 I lost a child when I was 15, a second child when I was 16. ||| 15岁无左第一个细路 16岁无左第二个。 
 So the story with Zacarias was too much really. ||| 所以撒迦利亚噶事对我来讲意味住好多野。 
 And I still suffer, because my son is like he's buried alive. ||| 我仲沉浸于悲痛当中， 因为我噶仔 就好似被活埋左咁。 
 I know she really cried for her son. ||| 我知道距的确为距噶仔悲痛欲绝。 
 But she knows where he is. ||| 但系距至少知道距系边。 
 My son, I don't know where he is. ||| 但我甚至唔知道我噶仔到底系边。 
 I don't know if he's alive. I don't know if he's tortured. ||| 唔知距是否生还，唔知有无被人虐待。 
 I don't know what happened to him. ||| 唔知距身上发生左咩。 
 So that's why I decided to tell my story, so that my suffering is something positive for other women. ||| 哩个亦系我决定讲述我噶故事噶原因， 令我噶痛苦可以帮到其他女性。 
 For all the women, all the mothers that give life, you can give back, you can change. ||| 为左所有噶女性，所有赋予生命噶妈咪， 可以恢复， 可以改变 
 It's up to us women, because we are women, because we love our children. ||| 哩个决定于我地女性， 因为我地系女人， 我地爱我地噶仔女。 
 We must be hand-in-hand and do something together. ||| 我地一定要联合起来 做一D野。 
 It's not against women, it's for us, for us women, for our children. ||| 哩件事唔系要反对女性， 系为左我地，我地女性， 为左我地噶仔女。 
 I talk against violence, against terrorism. ||| 我反对暴力，反对恐怖主义。 
 I go to schools to talk to young, Muslim girls so they don't accept to be married against their will very young. ||| 我去学校 同果D年轻噶穆斯林女仔交流 叫距地少年时期唔好接受违背意志噶婚姻。 
 So if I can save one of the young girls, and avoid that they get married and suffer as much as I did, well this is something good. ||| 如果我可以拯救一个女孩， 令到避免距地太早结婚好似我咁受苦受难， 至少就系一件好事。 
 This is why I'm here in front of you. ||| 所以我要企系你地面前。 
 PR: I would like to say that I have learned so much from Aicha, starting with that day we had our very first meeting with other family members — which was a very private meeting with security, because it was November 2002, and, frankly, we were afraid of the super-patriotism of that time in the country — those of us family members. ||| 菲莉斯·罗德里格斯：我想讲噶系 我从艾沙身上学到好多野， 回忆起我地第一次见面果阵 仲有其他家庭 哩个系一个受高度保护噶私下聚会， 因为果阵系2002年11月， 讲实话，我地好担心国内D爱国主义者 果D家庭成员。 
 But we were all so nervous. ||| 但系我地都好紧张。 
 ""Why does she want to meet us?"" ||| ”点解距想见我地？“ 
 And then she was nervous. ||| 距都好紧张。 
 ""Why did we want to meet her?"" ||| ”点解我地想见距？“ 
 What did we want from each other? ||| 我地互相之间可以得到咩呢？ 
 Before we knew each others' names, or anything, we had embraced and wept. ||| 系我地相互了解姓名同其他野之前， 我地已经缆埋一齐喊晒。 
 Then we sat in a circle with support, with help, from people experienced in this kind of reconciliation. ||| 跟住我地坐成一圈 系相互和解噶气氛下同经历过哩件事噶人 相互支持，相互帮助。 
 "And Aicha started, and she said, ""I don't know if my son is guilty or innocent, but I want to tell you how sorry I am for what happened to your families." ||| 艾沙头先话 ”我唔知道 我噶仔 有罪定系无辜， 但系我想话比你地噶系我对于发生系 你地屋企噶事感到非常非常抱歉。 
 "I know what it is to suffer, and I feel that if there is a crime, a person should be tried fairly and punished."" But she reached out to us in that way, and it was, I'd like to say, it was an ice-breaker." ||| 我明白咁样好痛苦， 而且我认为，如果有人犯罪， 距应该受到公平对待和惩罚。” 距就系感样同我地接触。 我想讲，哩个系一次破冰之旅。 
 And what happened then is we all told our stories, and we all connected as human beings. ||| 我地所讲噶故事就系所发生噶一切， 我地因人类而相互连接住 
 By the end of the afternoon — it was about three hours after lunch — we'd felt as if we'd known each other forever. ||| 下午结束果阵 大概系午饭后3个钟 我地觉得好似彼此之间永远了解咁。 
 Now what I learned from her, is a woman, not only who could be so generous under these present circumstances and what it was then, and what was being done to her son, but the life she's had. ||| 我从距身上学到噶系 作为一个女人，可以变得如此宽容 唔单单系当时噶情况下 当时发生噶事情， 和距噶仔经历过噶惨痛遭遇， 仲有距经历过噶人生。 
 I never had met someone with such a hard life, from such a totally different culture and environment from my own. ||| 系我经历果咁多唔同噶文化环境入边， 我从来未见过 命运如此坎坷噶人。 
 And I feel that we have a special connection, which I value very much. ||| 我觉得 我地之间有种 特别噶联系， 一种我好珍惜噶联系。 
 "And I think it's all about being afraid of the other, but making that step and then realizing, ""Hey, this wasn't so hard." ||| 我觉得哩个都系因为 我地互相之间噶关心， 但系当时做到哩步 会觉得：“啊，唔系咁难姐。” 
 "Who else can I meet that I don't know, or that I'm so different from?"" So, Aicha, do you have a couple of words for conclusion?" ||| 我仲可以见到D我唔了解噶人， 亦或者系同我地唔同噶人。 艾沙 你仲有无野 需要总结吗？ 
 Because our time is up. ||| 我地时间快到了 
 (Laughter) (Translator) AW: I wanted to say that we have to try to know other people, the other. ||| （笑声） （译者）艾莎·瓦非：我想讲 我地要尝试了解其他人、其他事情 
 You have to be generous, and your hearts must be generous, your mind must be generous. ||| 你要更加大方， 同埋你噶内心都要更加宽容， 你噶想法要更大宽容。 
 You must be tolerant. ||| 你要学识宽恕。 
 You have to fight against violence. ||| 我地不得不同暴力抗争 
 And I hope that someday we'll all live together in peace and respecting each other. ||| 我希望有一日我地会生活埋一齐 和平地在尊重人地 
 This is what I wanted to say. ||| 哩个就系我想讲噶。 
 (Applause) ||| （掌声） 
 Embracing otherness. ||| 包容他人。 
 When I first heard this theme, I thought, well, embracing otherness is embracing myself. ||| 當我第一次聽到嚟個主題， 我唸，包容他人 就系擁抱自己。 
 And the journey to that place of understanding and acceptance has been an interesting one for me, and it's given me an insight into the whole notion of self, which I think is worth sharing with you today. ||| 之所以會有嚟種想法 系因為深刻體會和接受。 我覺得非常有趣， 同埋給予我一種對自我的 洞察見解 今天，我想將嚟個見解同在座的各位分享 
 We each have a self, but I don't think that we're born with one. ||| 我地每個人都有一個自我， 但我唔認為嚟種自我系與生俱來的。 
 You know how newborn babies believe they're part of everything; they're not separate? ||| 你知道，新生兒 相信距地系萬物中的一體； 他們沒有分離。 
 Well that fundamental sense of oneness is lost on us very quickly. ||| 嚟種萬物歸一嘅概念 被我地好快就遺忘了。 
 It's like that initial stage is over — oneness: infancy, unformed, primitive. ||| 就好似人生最初階段好快就結束咗— 統一性：雛形， 未成型，原始的。 
 It's no longer valid or real. ||| 嚟種萬物歸一嘅概念對於我地來講已經失真，失效。 
 What is real is separateness, and at some point in early babyhood, the idea of self starts to form. ||| 取而代之嘅系獨立性。 就系初生嬰兒時期， 自我的概念 開始成型。 
 Our little portion of oneness is given a name, is told all kinds of things about itself, and these details, opinions and ideas become facts, which go towards building ourselves, our identity. ||| 從起名開始，自我的小部分開始萌芽， 開始得知各種關於自己的事情。 嚟D細節， 觀點同見解 成為事實， 逐漸構造我地自我， 同我地身份。 
 And that self becomes the vehicle for navigating our social world. ||| 與此同時自我便成為我地 系嚟個社會行動嘅方向。 
 But the self is a projection based on other people's projections. ||| 但系嚟個自我只是一個投影 一個建立於他人對你睇法嘅投影。 
 Is it who we really are? ||| 距可以真實反映我們嗎？ 
 Or who we really want to be, or should be? ||| 或者真實的反映我們想成為點樣， 又或者應該系點樣？ 
 So this whole interaction with self and identity was a very difficult one for me growing up. ||| 所有嚟D自我同身份 相互交流 伴隨我成長嘅過程中一個大難題。 
 The self that I attempted to take out into the world was rejected over and over again. ||| 我試圖呈現俾世界嘅真我 受到一次又一次嘅打擊。 
 And my panic at not having a self that fit, and the confusion that came from my self being rejected, created anxiety, shame and hopelessness, which kind of defined me for a long time. ||| 而我恐慌 沒有一個適合自己的自我， 以及因拒絕繼而 產生嘅困惑 又帶來焦慮，羞愧 同埋無助感， 系好長一段時間內，嚟D感受一直牽引住我的生命。 
 But in retrospect, the destruction of my self was so repetitive that I started to see a pattern. ||| 但反過來唸下， 我嘅自我被摧毀的系如此頻繁， 幫我睇到一個規律的存在。 
 The self changed, got affected, broken, destroyed, but another one would evolve — sometimes stronger, sometimes hateful, sometimes not wanting to be there at all. ||| 我嘅自我開始改變， 被外界影響，被摧毀打碎， 另一個我又逐漸開始產生—— 有時好勇敢， 有時充滿憤恨， 有時根本唔想存在。 
 The self was not constant. ||| 黎個自我系唔穩定。 
 And how many times would my self have to die before I realized that it was never alive in the first place? ||| 又有多少次 我嘅自我要死去 先至領悟 黎個自我從始至終根本唔存在？ 
 I grew up on the coast of England in the '70s. ||| 我成長於英國沿海地帶 70年代 
 My dad is white from Cornwall, and my mom is black from Zimbabwe. ||| 我爸爸系白人來自康沃尔郡， 而我媽媽系黑人來自津巴布韦。 
 Even the idea of us as a family was challenging to most people. ||| 即使作為一個咁樣嘅家庭， 對於好多人來講都未必接受。 
 But nature had its wicked way, and brown babies were born. ||| 但系自然就有距獨特嘅方式， 一個棕色嬰兒就此誕生。 
 But from about the age of five, I was aware that I didn't fit. ||| 但大概從五歲開始， 我就意識到，我與黎個世界格格不入。 
 I was the black atheist kid in the all-white Catholic school run by nuns. ||| 我系一個無神論嘅黑人小孩 就讀一間由修女掌管嘅全白人天主教學校。 
 I was an anomaly, and my self was rooting around for definition and trying to plug in. ||| 我就係一個異常。 而我四處為自我去尋找定義， 並試圖找到切入點去融入。 
 Because the self likes to fit, to see itself replicated, to belong. ||| 因為自我希望融入， 睇到自己被複製， 搵到歸屬。 
 That confirms its existence and its importance. ||| 因為肯定自我的存在 以及其重要性。 
 And it is important. ||| 確實，咁樣好重要。 
 It has an extremely important function. ||| 具有极其重要的的功能。 
 Without it, we literally can't interface with others. ||| 無咗距，我地根本無法與人交往。 
 We can't hatch plans and climb that stairway of popularity, of success. ||| 我地無辦法孵化計劃 不斷向上爬，變得更受歡迎， 更為成功。 
 But my skin color wasn't right. ||| 不過我嘅膚色唔o岩。 
 My hair wasn't right. ||| 我嘅頭髮唔o岩。 
 My history wasn't right. ||| 我個人嘅歷史唔o岩。 
 My self became defined by otherness, which meant that, in that social world, I didn't really exist. ||| 我嘅自我被相異性， 所定義， 咁就意味著，系黎個社會， 我唔存在。 
 "And I was ""other"" before being anything else — even before being a girl." ||| 而我首先系個異類，黎個身份 甚至比作為一個女仔更先考慮。 
 I was a noticeable nobody. ||| 我系一個引人注目無名小卒。 
 Another world was opening up around this time: performance and dancing. ||| 與此同時，另一個世界 向我招手： 演出與舞蹈。 
 That nagging dread of self-hood didn't exist when I was dancing. ||| 那個無時無刻都存在對自我身份嘅擔憂 當我跳舞時都不再存在。 
 I'd literally lose myself. ||| 我真系拋棄了自我。 
 And I was a really good dancer. ||| 我系一個非常優秀嘅舞者。 
 I would put all my emotional expression into my dancing. ||| 我會把 我全部的感情 投入在舞蹈中。 
 I could be in the movement in a way that I wasn't able to be in my real life, in myself. ||| 我可以舞出在 現實生活中無法 做到嘅自我。 
 And at 16, I stumbled across another opportunity, and I earned my first acting role in a film. ||| 在我16歲的時候， 我遇到另一個機會， 我得到咗第一次出演電影嘅機會。 
 I can hardly find the words to describe the peace I felt when I was acting. ||| 我難以用言語 來形容當時我所感受到嘅平和 當我演出時。 
 My dysfunctional self could actually plug in to another self, not my own, and it felt so good. ||| 我無法運轉嘅自我 卻可以融入到 不屬於我自己的自我。 黎種感受實在太好啦。 
 It was the first time that I existed inside a fully-functioning self — one that I controlled, that I steered, that I gave life to. ||| 黎個系我第一次感受到自己嘅存在 一個完全正常的自我裡。 一個自我可以控制， 我可以掌托， 我給予其生命。 
 But the shooting day would end, and I'd return to my gnarly, awkward self. ||| 但系當拍攝完結時， 我重回到 果個粗燥，蠢鈍嘅我。 
 By 19, I was a fully-fledged movie actor, but still searching for definition. ||| 19歲的時候， 我已成為一個完羽翼豐滿的電影演員， 但系我仲系到找尋自我的定義。 
 I applied to read anthropology at university. ||| 我申請攻讀人類學 系大學。 
 "Dr. Phyllis Lee gave me my interview, and she asked me, ""How would you define race?"" Well, I thought I had the answer to that one, and I said, ""Skin color."" ""So biology, genetics?"" she said." ||| 菲利斯·李博士面試我， 她問我，“你系點樣定義種族？” 我以為知道黎題嘅答案。 我講， ”膚色“。 “咁你即系話， 生物，基因咯？” 距講。 
 """Because, Thandie, that's not accurate." ||| ”不過， 桑迪，黎個答案唔準確喔。 
 Because there's actually more genetic difference between a black Kenyan and a black Ugandan than there is between a black Kenyan and, say, a white Norwegian. ||| 因為系基因上 一個黑皮膚嘅肯尼亞人 同一個黑皮膚嘅烏干達人 的差別好多。 一個黑皮膚嘅肯尼亞人。 比如同， 一個白膚色挪威人之間亦有區別。 
 Because we all stem from Africa. ||| 因為我地都來自非洲。 
 "So in Africa, there's been more time to create genetic diversity."" In other words, race has no basis in biological or scientific fact." ||| 所以系非洲， 有更長嘅時間 來形成基因多樣化。 “ 換言之， 種族的劃分 系無生物同科學的依據。 
 On the one hand, result. ||| 一方面系結果。 
 Right? ||| o岩唔o岩？ 
 On the other hand, my definition of self just lost a huge chunk of its credibility. ||| 系另一方面， 我對自我嘅定義 就咁樣失去一大部分可信性。 
 But what was credible, what is biological and scientific fact, is that we all stem from Africa — in fact, from a woman called Mitochondrial Eve who lived 160,000 years ago. ||| 可信嘅系， 生物學與科學事實， 就係我地都係來自非洲— 事實上， 我地都源自一個女人-『粒線體夏娃』 她生後在16萬年前。 
 And race is an illegitimate concept which our selves have created based on fear and ignorance. ||| 所以，種族系一個不合理的概念 系我地自我所塑造的 基於恐慌與無知。 
 Strangely, these revelations didn't cure my low self-esteem, that feeling of otherness. ||| 奇怪嘅系，了解到黎一切 並沒有治愈好我卑微的自尊， 仲系有果種異類感。 
 My desire to disappear was still very powerful. ||| 我想要就此消失的祈望 還是非常強烈。 
 I had a degree from Cambridge; I had a thriving career, but my self was a car crash, and I wound up with bulimia and on a therapist's couch. ||| 我有一個劍橋學位； 我嘅蒸蒸日上； 但我自己就似一場車禍， 結果我患上厭食症 並開始接受心理治療。 
 And of course I did. ||| 我當然會變成咁。 
 I still believed my self was all I was. ||| 當時我仍然相信 我的自我便是我的全部。 
 I still valued self-worth above all other worth, and what was there to suggest otherwise? ||| 我依然非常自重 勝於其他所有的價值。 我仲可以點唸？ 
 We've created entire value systems and a physical reality to support the worth of self. ||| 我地所創造出嘅整個價值系統 客觀存在緊 都系為著支撐黎個自我的價值觀。 
 Look at the industry for self-image and the jobs it creates, the revenue it turns over. ||| 睇下周邊為個人形象所建立的產業 仲有相關聯工作， 創造出的價值。 
 We'd be right in assuming that the self is an actual living thing. ||| 我地仲好去認為 黎個自我系個真實存在的東西。 
 But it's not. It's a projection which our clever brains create in order to cheat ourselves from the reality of death. ||| 不過答案系否定的；黎只系一個投影， 一個我們聰明大腦所塑造出的投影 用來欺騙我地自己 好讓我地無需面對死亡黎個現實。 
 But there is something that can give the self ultimate and infinite connection — and that thing is oneness, our essence. ||| 但系有樣嘢 距可以給予自我 終極，無限的聯繫— 黎個就係合一性， 我們的本質。 
 The self's struggle for authenticity and definition will never end unless it's connected to its creator — to you and to me. ||| 自我的鬥爭 為尋找真實性和定義 系永無休止 除非自我與其創造者一齊— 同你， 同我。 
 And that can happen with awareness — awareness of the reality of oneness and the projection of self-hood. ||| 只要真正意識到黎點— 意識到合一性的真實存在 與自我其實僅僅系一個投影。 
 For a start, we can think about all the times when we do lose ourselves. ||| o岩開始的時，我地可以咁唸 當我地可以忘我的時。 
 It happens when I dance, when I'm acting. ||| 對我而言，但我跳舞時就會忘掉自己， 當我系表演時。 
 I'm earthed in my essence, and my self is suspended. ||| 我接近我的本質， 把自我暫停。 
 In those moments, I'm connected to everything — the ground, the air, the sounds, the energy from the audience. ||| 系黎段時間內， 我與萬物相連— 大地，空氣， 聲音，觀眾中的能量。 
 All my senses are alert and alive in much the same way as an infant might feel — that feeling of oneness. ||| 我所有感官都醒覺充滿活力 就好似一個初生嬰兒一樣—- 感覺到合一性。 
 And when I'm acting a role, I inhabit another self, and I give it life for awhile, because when the self is suspended so is divisiveness and judgment. ||| 當我表演一個角色的時候， 我居住在另一個自我裡， 我在一個段時間裡給予其生命。 因為，當我的自我被暫停後 分離與 評判的態度都被暫停。 
 And I've played everything from a vengeful ghost in the time of slavery to Secretary of State in 2004. ||| 我中意表演各種角色 從奴隸時代復仇心重嘅鬼魂 到生活在2004年的國務卿。 
 And no matter how other these selves might be, they're all related in me. ||| 無論別人的自我如何， 與我有多麼相異， 我都可以理解他們。 
 And I honestly believe the key to my success as an actor and my progress as a person has been the very lack of self that used to make me feel so anxious and insecure. ||| 而我真的相信 成為一位成功演員的關鍵 還有我做為一個人進步的原因 就係我缺乏自我 即使黎種缺乏在過去令我感到 無比焦慮， 缺乏安全感。 
 I always wondered why I could feel others' pain so deeply, why I could recognize the somebody in the nobody. ||| 我時時唸 點解我可以如此深刻感受到他人的痛楚， 點解我可以睇到 無名小卒裡的不平凡靈魂。 
 It's because I didn't have a self to get in the way. ||| 因為我沒有一個自我來檔路。 
 I thought I lacked substance, and the fact that I could feel others' meant that I had nothing of myself to feel. ||| 我本以為我缺乏實在的存在， 還有我能夠感受他人 系因為我沒有一個自我的感受。 
 The thing that was a source of shame was actually a source of enlightenment. ||| 在過去缺乏自我令我感到羞愧 反而依家成為我感悟的源泉。 
 And when I realized and really understood that my self is a projection and that it has a function, a funny thing happened. ||| 當我意識到， 並清楚知道後 我的自我只是一個投影，黎個自我有自己的功用， 一件有得意嘅事發生。 
 I stopped giving it so much authority. ||| 我不在給我的自我很多權力。 
 I give it its due. ||| 我開始對它進行磨練。 
 I take it to therapy. ||| 我帶我的自我做心理治療。 
 I've become very familiar with its dysfunctional behavior. ||| 我已經對自我 不良的行為好熟悉。 
 But I'm not ashamed of my self. ||| 但我不再對自己感到羞愧。 
 In fact, I respect my self and its function. ||| 事實上， 我開始尊重自己 自我運轉的功能。 
 And over time and with practice, I've tried to live more and more from my essence. ||| 通過長時間鍛煉， 我不斷嘗試從我的 本源生活。 
 And if you can do that, incredible things happen. ||| 如果你可以做到黎一點， 奇妙的事情就會發生。 
 I was in Congo in February, dancing and celebrating with women who've survived the destruction of their selves in literally unthinkable ways — destroyed because other brutalized, psychopathic selves all over that beautiful land are fueling our selves' addiction to iPods, Pads, and bling, which further disconnect ourselves from ever feeling their pain, their suffering, their death. ||| 二月份當我系剛果，果陣時， 與自我遭到被無法想像的 真實毀滅女性 一起跳舞慶祝 系字面上無法形容— 與其他被摧殘了的扭曲心靈的自我的人們 一起同在黎片美麗的土地 來推動我地自省的意識，抵觸自我上癮 對於iPods, iPads同埋其他外表光鮮的事物 黎D另我地上癮，令我地中斷接近自己 黎D癮另我地更加無法感到他人的痛苦， 他人的磨難， 他人的存亡/ 
 Because, hey, if we're all living in ourselves and mistaking it for life, then we're devaluing and desensitizing life. ||| 因為， 如果我地各自活在自我的生活裡， 還以為咁就係人生， 那麼我地正在貶低人生的價值 對一切都不在敏感。 
 And in that disconnected state, yeah, we can build factory farms with no windows, destroy marine life and use rape as a weapon of war. ||| 系咁樣一個隔離狀態， 無錯，我地可以建造一個唔需要窗嘅工廠， 摧毀海洋生命 用強暴作為戰爭的武器。 
 So here's a note to self: The cracks have started to show in our constructed world, and oceans will continue to surge through the cracks, and oil and blood, rivers of it. ||| 所以， 我有一個對於自我的建議： 在我地塑造的鋼筋水泥世界 已經呈現裂痕， 大海將會不斷的 沿著裂縫上湧， 仲有石油和血， 將匯流成河。 
 Crucially, we haven't been figuring out how to live in oneness with the Earth and every other living thing. ||| 關鍵就係，我地仲沒搵到 怎樣與地球 以及其他生物合一共存。 
 We've just been insanely trying to figure out how to live with each other — billions of each other. ||| 我地瘋狂地試圖尋找 與其他人共存的方式- 幾十億人類。 
 Only we're not living with each other; our crazy selves are living with each other and perpetuating an epidemic of disconnection. ||| 不過並唔係我地系一起生活， 而我地系瘋狂的自我生活在一起 不斷的蔓延，讓我們無法交匯 產生溝通疫病。 
 Let's live with each other and take it a breath at a time. ||| 讓我們真正的生活在一起 一步一步來， 
 If we can get under that heavy self, light a torch of awareness, and find our essence, our connection to the infinite and every other living thing. ||| 如果我地可以潛伏在自我之下， 點燃自省的火炬， 去尋找我們的根源， 咁我地就可以無限 並與萬物產生聯繫的紐帶。 
 We knew it from the day we were born. ||| 我們從出生之日便知黎個紐帶。 
 Let's not be freaked out by our bountiful nothingness. ||| 我們不需要因為 大把的空虛而感到慌張。 
 It's more a reality than the ones our selves have created. ||| 我們生存的狀態就是一個事實 僅僅系我們自己創造的。 
 Imagine what kind of existence we can have if we honor inevitable death of self, appreciate the privilege of life and marvel at what comes next. ||| 想像下，我們的生存方式會系點樣 如果我地能夠直面自我不可避免的死亡， 珍惜我們可以生存的權利 對即將發生的事情保持驚喜之心。 
 Simple awareness is where it begins. ||| 黎D簡單的意識，就是回歸根本的開始。 
 Thank you for listening. ||| 感謝你地來聽我的演講。 
 (Applause) ||| （掌聲） 
 I would like to tell you all that you are all actually cyborgs, but not the cyborgs that you think. ||| 我想同你哋講， 其實你哋都係半機械人， 不過唔係你哋念嘅果種半機械人。 
 You're not RoboCop, and you're not Terminator, but you're cyborgs every time you look at a computer screen or use one of your cell phone devices. ||| 你哋唔係鐵甲威龍，亦都唔係終結者， 但係每次你望住個屏幕 或者用手機果陣，你就係一個半機械人。 
 So what's a good definition for cyborg? ||| 甘點先為止正宗嘅半機械人呢？ 
 "Well, traditional definition is ""an organism to which exogenous components have been added for the purpose of adapting to new environments."" That came from a 1960 paper on space travel, because, if you think about it, space is pretty awkward." ||| 嗱，傳統嚟講就係 “一個有機體為咗適應新環衛 而被添加外部組件。” 呢種講法係源於1960年一篇記錄太空漫遊嘅文章。 因為你認真唸下，太空其實好可怕； 
 People aren't supposed to be there. ||| 人類本嚟就唔應該係果度。 
 But humans are curious, and they like to add things to their bodies so they can go to the Alps one day and then become a fish in the sea the next. ||| 不過人類都係好有奇心嘅，佢哋鐘意係自己身上加啲嘢， 所以總有一日佢地可以爬上阿爾卑斯山， 跟住另外一日又變成海底嘅一條魚。 
 So let's look at the concept of traditional anthropology. ||| 等我哋嚟睇下傳統概唸上嘅人類學係觀點。 
 "Somebody goes to another country, says, ""How fascinating these people are, how interesting their tools are, how curious their culture is."" And then they write a paper, and maybe a few other anthropologists read it, and we think it's very exotic." ||| 有條友去咗另一個國家， 佢話：“呢度啲人真係神奇，佢哋嘅架撐真係得意， 距哋嘅文化好盞鬼。” 跟住佢地係張紙度寫咗啲也，或者咁啱有幾個人類學家睇度， 我哋就會覺得呢單也靈舍有異國情調。 
 Well, what's happening is that we've suddenly found a new species. ||| 而同時發生嘅係我哋突然發現咗 一個新品種。 
 "I, as a cyborg anthropologist, have suddenly said, ""Oh, wow. Now suddenly we're a new form of Homo sapiens, and look at these fascinating cultures, and look at these curious rituals that everybody's doing around this technology." ||| 我，作為一個研究半機械人嘅人類學家，實會話： “哇，依家我哋突然間成為咗新新人類啦。 過嚟睇下呢啲引人入勝嘅文化， 再睇下呢啲令人好奇嘅儀式， 個個都圍繞呢項技術做嘢。 
 "They're clicking on things and staring at screens."" Now there's a reason why I study this, versus traditional anthropology." ||| 佢哋一路點擊，一路望著個屏幕。” 我之所以去研究呢樣也， 而唔係傳統人類學係有原因嘅。 
 And the reason is that tool use, in the beginning — for thousands and thousands of years, everything has been a physical modification of self. ||| 因為工具嘅使用， 係一開始，經過咗千萬年， 所有也都係人類挪嚟改造自身。 
 It has helped us to extend our physical selves, go faster, hit things harder, and there's been a limit on that. ||| 工具幫助我哋擴展自身嘅技能， 令我哋跑得更快，錘嘢錘得更有力， 雖然一切都有個限度。 
 But now what we're looking at is not an extension of the physical self, but an extension of the mental self, and because of that, we're able to travel faster, communicate differently. ||| 但係依家我哋睇度嘅唔係人類自身技能嘅擴展， 而係心智嘅延伸。 由於咁，我哋可以走得更快， 更多元化咁交流。 
 And the other thing that happens is that we're all carrying around little Mary Poppins technology. ||| 第二件發生哽嘅嘢就係 我哋都隨身攜帶住Mary Poppins嘅技術。 
 We can put anything we want into it, and it doesn't get heavier, and then we can take anything out. ||| 我地可以將任何野擺在我地想放噶任何地方，唔重咖， 然之後又可以從入面挪距出來。 
 What does the inside of your computer actually look like? ||| 你台電腦入面究竟有啲咩呢？ 
 Well, if you print it out, it looks like a thousand pounds of material that you're carrying around all the time. ||| 嗱，如果你將佢打印出嚟，就好似你要運輸 成千磅重嘅信息材料。 
 And if you actually lose that information, it means that you suddenly have this loss in your mind, that you suddenly feel like something's missing, except you aren't able to see it, so it feels like a very strange emotion. ||| 而且，如果你真係唔見咗果啲信息， 你個心就會覺得突然之間冇咗一啲嘢， 就好似突然之間感覺失去咗一啲嘢， 除非你無辦法見度呢啲嘢，距就好似D好奇怪噶感覺。 
 The other thing that happens is that you have a second self. ||| 另外一件發生咗嘅嘢就係你擁有第二個自己。 
 Whether you like it or not, you're starting to show up online, and people are interacting with your second self when you're not there. ||| 無論你鐘唔鍾意，你都開始係線上出現， 當你唔係果度， 人哋就開始同第二個你交流， 
 And so you have to be careful about leaving your front lawn open, which is basically your Facebook wall, so that people don't write on it in the middle of the night — because it's very much the equivalent. ||| 咁你就要小心， 唔好輕易開放你嘅第一道防線， 基本上嚟講就係你嘅Facebook， 唔好比人哋係深夜係上面寫嘢， 因為呢個效果同現實生活係好大程度上係等價嘅。 
 And suddenly we have to start to maintain our second self. ||| 所以突然之間，我哋開始維護第二個自己， 
 You have to present yourself in digital life in a similar way that you would in your analog life. ||| 你不得不以一種你係現實中呈現嘅方式 相似咁係數碼生活中呈現。 
 So, in the same way that you wake up, take a shower and get dressed, you have to learn to do that for your digital self. ||| 就好似你起身，冲個涼，著衫， 你一樣要學識係數碼生活中去做同樣嘅也。 
 And the problem is that a lot of people now, especially adolescents, have to go through two adolescences. ||| 不過問題在於家陣好多人， 尤其係青少年， 需要經歷兩個青春期。 
 They have to go through their primary one, that's already awkward, and then they go through their second self's adolescence, and that's even more awkward because there's an actual history of what they've gone through online. ||| 佢哋要經歷第一個青春期已經好唔容易， 依家仲要經歷自己第二個青春期。 咁就更加之難。 因為係呢個真實嘅網絡歷史入面 佢哋經歷都會被記錄。 
 And anybody coming in new to technology is an adolescent online right now, and so it's very awkward, and it's very difficult for them to do those things. ||| 依家每個啱開始接觸新科技嘅人， 都係網上嘅青少年。 所以，要佢地去做果啲嘢 係好奇怪同埋困難嘅。 
 "So when I was little, my dad would sit me down at night and he would say, "I'm going to teach you about time and space in the future."" ||| 係我好細個果陣，夜晚我老窦會叫我坐低跟住同我講： “我要教你一樣關於未來時間同空間嘅嘢。” 
 "And I said, ""Great."" And he said one day, ""What's the shortest distance between two points?"" And I said, ""Well, that's a straight line. You told me that yesterday."" I thought I was very clever." ||| 我話：“好啊！” 有一日佢問我：“兩點之間最短嘅距離係咩？” 我話：“哦，直線啰。你琴日係咁同我講嘅。” 我唸住我好醒目， 
 "He said, ""No, no, no. Here's a better way."" He took a piece of paper, drew A and B on one side and the other and folded them together so where A and B touched." ||| 點知佢話：“唔啱，唔啱，呢個先係更短嘅路徑。” 佢挪咗一張紙， 係一面寫咗個A，另外一面寫咗個B， 跟住折埋兩邊令到A掂到B。 
 "And he said, ""That is the shortest distance between two points."" And I said, ""Dad, dad, dad, how do you do that?"" He said, ""Well, you just bend time and space, it takes an awful lot of energy, and that's just how you do it."" And I said, ""I want to do that."" And he said, ""Well, okay."" And so, when I went to sleep for the next 10 or 20 years, I was thinking at night, ""I want to be the first person to create a wormhole, to make things accelerate faster." ||| 佢話：”呢個先系兩點之間最短嘅距離。“ 我跟住問：”老窦，老窦，老窦，你點做度嘎？“ 佢話：“嗱，呢個先係兩點之間最短嘅距離， 要用好多能量， 跟住就可以做到喇。” 我話：“我都想做到啊！” 佢話：“好啊！” 跟住，係接落嚟呢10幾20年，每當我夜晚訓覺時 我就會唸， “我一定會係第一個創造出“蟲洞”嘅人， 令事物加速。 
 "And I want to make a time machine."" I was always sending messages to my future self using tape recorders." ||| 我仲要製造一台時光機。” 我經常用錄音機嚟發信息 比未來嘅自己。 
 But then what I realized when I went to college is that technology doesn't just get adopted because it works. ||| 但係當我讀大學果陣，我意識到， 技術唔會因為佢有用 而被人類接受， 
 It gets adopted because people use it and it's made for humans. ||| 而係人類用過之後先會被接受。 因為佢係為滿足人類所需而創造嘅。 
 So I started studying anthropology. ||| 所以，我開始研究人類學。 
 And when I was writing my thesis on cell phones, I realized that everyone was carrying around wormholes in their pockets. ||| 當我係度寫哽關於手機嘅論文時， 我意識到每個人嘅口袋入面都隨身帶著個”蟲洞“。 
 They weren't physically transporting themselves; they were mentally transporting themselves. ||| 呢個“蟲洞”唔係通過身體接觸嚟傳遞信息， 而係從心智上傳遞。 
 They would click on a button, and they would be connected as A to B immediately. ||| 人類點擊一下按鈕， 跟住以A身份同B取得聯繫。 
 "And I thought, ""Oh, wow. I found it. This is great."" So over time, time and space have compressed because of this." ||| 跟住我唸：“噢，哇，我穩到啦！真係太好啦！” 所以，隨住時間推移，時間同空間 都因為咁而被壓縮埋一齊。 
 You can stand on one side of the world, whisper something and be heard on the other. ||| 你可以企係地球嘅一邊， 細細聲講嘢，而且可以比另外一邊嘅人聽到。 
 One of the other ideas that comes around is that you have a different type of time on every single device that you use. ||| 仲有就係， 你用嘅唔同設備可以比你擁有唔同類型嘅時間。 
 Every single browser tab gives you a different type of time. ||| 每一個瀏覽標籤都比你一個唔同嘅時間軸。 
 And because of that, you start to dig around for your external memories — where did you leave them? ||| 而且因為咁，你開始到處發掘延伸嘅記憶， 將佢哋收埋咗係邊呢？ 
 So now we're all these paleontologists that are digging for things that we've lost on our external brains that we're carrying around in our pockets. ||| 所以話依家我哋都係古生物學家， 不停咁發掘我哋失去嘅嘢， 我哋將外部大腦隨身帶係口袋入面。 
 "And that incites a sort of panic architecture — "Oh no, where's this thing?"" ||| 咁樣會促發一種恐慌。 弊，啲嘢究竟存咗係邊度？ 
 "We're all ""I Love Lucy"" on a great assembly line of information, and we can't keep up." ||| 係信息狂潮嚟臨前，我哋都好似”我愛Lucy“電視入面演嘅咁狼狽， 而且我哋冇辦法追得上信息嘅腳步。 
 And so what happens is, when we bring all that into the social space, we end up checking our phones all the time. ||| 由於咁， 我哋將所有嘢帶入到社交空間， 結果就係我哋會不停咁查看電話。 
 So we have this thing called ambient intimacy. ||| 呢個就係稱之為親密環境。 
 It's not that we're always connected to everybody, but at anytime we can connect to anyone we want. ||| 咁樣唔係話我哋經常同每個人聯繫， 而係話我哋可以隨時聯繫上我哋想聯繫嘅人。 
 And if you were able to print out everybody in your cell phone, the room would be very crowded. ||| 如果你可以將電話簿入面嘅人全部打印出嚟， 果間房就會變得非常壁， 
 These are the people that you have access to right now, in general — all of these people, all of your friends and family that you can connect to. ||| 一般嚟講呢哋就係你可以聯繫到嘅人 同埋同你保持聯繫嘅朋友，家人。 
 And so there are some psychological effects that happen with this. ||| 隨之而嚟嘅係我哋會有一種心理效應。 
 One I'm really worried about is that people aren't taking time for mental reflection anymore, and that they aren't slowing down and stopping, being around all those people in the room all the time that are trying to compete for their attention on the simultaneous time interfaces, paleontology and panic architecture. ||| 一種我好擔心嘅心理效應， 就係人類唔再花費時間嚟反省自己， 佢地唔再放慢節奏同埋停落嚟， 時刻同屋入面嘅人係埋一齊， 嘗試係同一時間內 獲得所有人嘅注意力， 同時活係研究 古生物學同埋面對恐慌嘅架構中。 
 They're not just sitting there. ||| 佢地唔止係坐埋一齊咁簡單。 
 And really, when you have no external input, that is a time when there is a creation of self, when you can do long-term planning, when you can try and figure out who you really are. ||| 講真果句，當你唔再受黎自外部嘅影響果陣， 你就有一段可以創造自我嘅時間， 一段可以作長遠計劃嘅時間， 嘗試發覺究竟自己係點樣一個人。 
 And then, once you do that, you can figure out how to present your second self in a legitimate way, instead of just dealing with everything as it comes in — and oh, I have to do this, and I have to do this, and I have to do this. ||| 而一旦你咁樣做，你就會搞清楚 應該點樣合理咁呈現第二個自己， 而唔係等所有嘢發生之後再臨時應對—— 哦，我要做呢個，我要做那個，我一定做呢個。 
 And so this is very important. ||| 所以呢一點係非常重要嘅。 
 I'm really worried that, especially kids today, they're not going to be dealing with this down-time, that they have an instantaneous button-clicking culture, and that everything comes to them, and that they become very excited about it and very addicted to it. ||| 我真係好擔心，尤其對依家嘅細路仔， 佢地冇靜低心嚟處理事情嘅時間， 因為佢地生活係一個不停點擊按鈕嘅文化中， 咩嘢都向佢地湧埋嚟， 佢地就會變得好興奮，甚至沉迷其中。 
 So if you think about it, the world hasn't stopped either. ||| 你唸下，呢個世界都未試過停落嚟。 
 It has its own external prosthetic devices, and these devices are helping us all to communicate and interact with each other. ||| 佢都有自己嘅外部修復設備， 而且呢啲設備都係度幫哽我哋 互相溝通同交流。 
 But when you actually visualize it, all the connections that we're doing right now — this is an image of the mapping of the Internet — it doesn't look technological. ||| 如果你可以見度呢啲 將我哋聯繫埋一齊嘅網路， 你會發覺呢個係一幅互聯網嘅地圖—— 佢睇起身無乜技術含量； 
 It actually looks very organic. ||| 不過事實上係有機化嘅。 
 This is the first time in the entire history of humanity that we've connected in this way. ||| 呢個係人類歷史上第一次 以咁樣嘅方式嚟連接每個人。 
 And it's not that machines are taking over. ||| 而且唔係部機器係度話事， 
 It's that they're helping us to be more human, helping us to connect with each other. ||| 而係佢幫我哽我哋變得更人性化， 更好咁同每個人溝通。 
 The most successful technology gets out of the way and helps us live our lives. ||| 最成功嘅技術係幫我哋排除障礙， 幫助我哋生活得更美好。 
 And really, it ends up being more human than technology, because we're co-creating each other all the time. ||| 確切嚟講， 機器令到我哋最後變得更人性化而非技術化， 因為我哋一路都係度互相合作，共同創造。 
 And so this is the important point that I like to study: that things are beautiful, that it's still a human connection — it's just done in a different way. ||| 呢個就係我想研究嘅一個重點： 事物係美好嘅，不過依然需要人與人之間嘅聯繫； 只不過係以一種唔同嘅方式。 
 We're just increasing our humanness and our ability to connect with each other, regardless of geography. ||| 我哋正係度增強自身嘅特性， 聯繫彼此嘅能力，不受地域嘅限制。 
 So that's why I study cyborg anthropology. ||| 呢個就係點解我要研究半機械人類學。 
 Thank you. ||| 多謝噻！ 
 (Applause) ||| （掌聲） 
 And for 18 years, those 57 meters of concrete stayed grey. ||| 幅 57 米高嘅石屎牆 18 年嚟都冇粉飾過 
 The most amazing thing about this imam is that he didn't ask me anything — neither a sketch, or what I was going to write. ||| 最正嘅係 無論係畫乜，定係我想寫乜 
 For the imam, it was not just the painting; it was really deeper than that. ||| 對教長嚟講，呢幅唔止係塗鴉 背後意義深遠得多 
 Writing messages is the essence of my artwork. ||| 文字訊息係我創作嘅精髓 
 Today I only write messages in Arabic. ||| 而家我只會用阿拉伯文創作 
 I was mad and disappointed. ||| 嗰刻我又嬲又失望 
 Today, I don't write the translation of the message anymore on the wall. ||| 今日，我唔再喺牆上翻譯我嘅文字 
 Thank you. ||| 多謝！ 
 (Applause) ||| （掌聲） 
 About two thirds, I would guess, of the world is desertifying. ||| 我估計地球上 有三分二嘅地方正荒漠化緊 
 I took this picture in the Tihamah Desert while 25 millimeters — that's an inch of rain — was falling. ||| 依幅相係我響提哈馬沙漠拍嘅 落緊 25 毫米、一吋嘅雨 
 Carbon goes back to the atmosphere. ||| 碳元素就會返到大氣層 
 That is the cancer of desertification that we do not recognize till its terminal form. ||| 而依樣就係荒漠化嘅致命成因 但我哋成日到咗荒漠化後期 先會發現得到 
 Now, no livestock were involved, but suspecting that we had too many elephants now, I did the research and I proved we had too many, and I recommended that we would have to reduce their numbers and bring them down to a level that the land could sustain. ||| 依家嗰度搵唔到牲畜 於是我哋懷疑嗰度大象嘅數目太多 經我調查，佢哋數量確實太多 我建議將佢哋嘅數量減少 下降到土地能承受嘅水平 
 Now, that was a terrible decision for me to have to make, and it was political dynamite, frankly. ||| 對我嚟講依個係好可怕嘅決定 老實講仲係一個政治炸彈 
 And it got worse, not better. ||| 只不過情況冇好到，反而轉差 
 One good thing did come out of it. ||| 但咁樣帶出咗一件事 
 You have changed the microclimate. ||| 因為你哋改變咗微觀氣候 
 We had no understanding of that. ||| 我哋真係乜都唔知企咗響度 
 It has just come through four months of rain, and it's now going into eight months of dry season. ||| 嗰度啱啱落咗四個月雨 亦都開始為期八個月嘅旱季 
 And watch the change as it goes into this long dry season. ||| 留意下佢經歷長期旱季嘅轉變 
 To prevent that, we have traditionally used fire. ||| 為咗阻止發生依個情況 我哋傳統上會用火燒 
 And bear in mind, I'm talking of most of the world's land now. ||| 提一提，我係講緊世上大部份嘅土地 
 What are we going to do? ||| 咁點算？ 
 There is no other alternative left to mankind. ||| 講多無謂，行動最實際 
 So on this bit of grassland, we'll do it, but just in the foreground. ||| 所以我哋先用一小塊草地嚟做試驗 
 We'll impact it very heavily with cattle to mimic nature, and we've done so, and look at that. ||| 我哋模仿大自然運作 養咗小牛去測試土地負荷 我哋依家做到啦，你睇下 
 All of that grass is now covering the soil as dung, urine and litter or mulch, as every one of the gardeners amongst you would understand, and that soil is ready to absorb and hold the rain, to store carbon, and to break down methane. ||| 全部土地都生曬草 因為泥土上有糞、尿 枯枝落葉同埋護根 在座各位有種開嘢嘅都明白 咁樣嘅泥土已經可以吸收同保留雨水 可以儲存碳又可以分解甲烷 
 Let's look at some results. ||| 我哋嚟睇下個結果 
 This is land close to land that we manage in Zimbabwe. ||| 依塊係近住我哋喺聿巴布韋嘅土地 
 It has just come through four months of very good rains it got that year, and it's going into the long dry season. ||| 嗰度啱啱勁落咗四個月雨 就快要到漫長嘅旱季 
 Now let's go to our land nearby on the same day, with the same rainfall, and look at that. ||| 依家嚟睇一睇同一日隔籬嗰塊地 同樣嘅降雨量，睇下 
 Our river is flowing and healthy and clean. ||| 我哋啲河水又多又乾淨 
 I'm just going to ask you one quick question. ||| 我想問你一個好短嘅問題 
 Thank you so much.AS: Well, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Chris. ||| 非常多謝你 
 So freedom came with responsibility. ||| 所以，自由嘅代價係責任 
 And let me tell you, kids with power tools are awesome and safe. ||| 等我話你知 
 And so this is how we work. ||| 呢個就係我哋做嘅方式 
 More than 14,000 people died in an instant. ||| 超過 14,000 人喺一瞬那喪生 
 This is the next step in the evolution. ||| 但係科技發展嘅下一步係 微軟公司嘅全息眼鏡 
 Now, this is the perspective I apply to my work every single day. ||| 宜家，等我話畀你聽 我每日做嘢嘅情景 
 So let's start our journey. ||| 咁宜家開始啦 
 The computer universe is both marvelous and primitive. ||| 電腦世界既不可思議、原始 又係基於因果定律 
 So why are screens so pervasive in our analog life? ||| 咁點解螢幕喺我哋 連貫嘅生活裏面咁普遍呢？ 
 That's displacement of space. ||| 呢個時候，空間改變咗 
 So how do we get there? ||| 咁我哋點先可以提升體驗？ 
 But how would that machine then interact with reality? ||| 但咁樣嘅機器 又點樣同現實世界互動呢？ 
 And I can think of three ways. ||| 我諗到三種方式 
 I love it down here. ||| 我太鍾意呢個景色啦 
 We already live in a world where real-time universal translators exist. ||| 今時今日嘅世界已經有即時空間轉換器 
 JN: Well, I'm actually in three places. ||| Jeff Norris︰好 
 But our dreams don't have to end with making it just like being there. ||| 但係，我哋嘅夢想 
 Perhaps someday, we'll feel the minerals in a rock just by touching it. ||| 可能有朝一日 
 We're taking the first steps. ||| 我哋宜家就係行緊第一步 
 AK: Thank you Jeff, this was amazing. ||| 多謝 Jeff！太震撼啦！ 
 It's a phenomenal time to be human. ||| 呢個將會係人類重要嘅轉捩點 
 JN: Yes? ||| Jeff Norris︰係 
 HW: Hi. ||| Helen Walters︰喂 
 AK: I'll take a step back. ||| 講者︰我褪後先 
 That's my question for a hologram. ||| 呢點係我對全息圖嘅疑慮 
 HW: Amazing. OK, Jeff, please go away. Thank you very much. ||| Helen Walters︰太勁啦 
 I started Improv Everywhere about 10 years ago when I moved to New York City with an interest in acting and comedy. ||| 十年前，我創辦咗“隨地即興” 當時我啱搬去紐約，對表演同喜劇非常感興趣。 
 Because I was new to the city, I didn't have access to a stage, so I decided to create my own in public places. ||| 不過我初嚟甫到，上唔到舞臺 所以决定要喺公眾場合創造我自己唧舞臺 
 So the first project we're going to take a look at is the very first No Pants Subway Ride. ||| 第一個要俾你哋睇唧喺 我策劃唧“第一屆唔著褲坐地鐵” 
 Now this took place in January of 2002. ||| 時間喺2002年1月 
 And this woman is the star of the video. ||| 依位女士喺依段片唧主角 
 She doesn't know she's being filmed. ||| 佢唔知自己被人影緊 
 She's being filmed with a hidden camera. ||| 因為我哋用唧喺偷拍用唧攝影機 
 This is on the 6 train in New York City. ||| 地點喺紐約6号線唧 
 And this is the first stop along the line. ||| 依度喺依条線唧第二個站 
 These are two Danish guys who come out and sit down next to the hidden camera. ||| 上嚟两个丹麥男子 坐咗系攝影機隔離 
 And that's me right there in a brown coat. ||| 著住啡色外套裹個就喺我 
 It's about 30 degrees outside. ||| 室外溫度喺零下1度左右 
 I'm wearing a hat. I'm wearing a scarf. ||| 我戴住帽同圍巾 
 And the girl's going to notice me right here. ||| 個女仔就快要發現我喇 
 (Laughter) And as you'll see now, I'm not wearing pants. (Laughter) ||| （笑聲） 可以睇到，我無著褲 （笑聲） 
 So at this point — at this point she's noticed me, but in New York there's weirdos on any given train car. ||| 所以而家 而家，佢注意到我了 但喺喺紐約，你隨時都可能喺地鐵見到怪人 
 One person's not that unusual. ||| 一個人無著褲，一啲都唔出奇 
 "She goes back to reading her book, which is unfortunately titled ""Rape."" (Laughter) So she's noticed the unusual thing, but she's gone back to her normal life." ||| 所以佢繼續睇佢唧書，咁啱得咁巧，佢本書唧名喺《強姦》 （笑聲） 嗱，佢意識到有奇怪唧事發生 但喺佢即刻又繼續正常唧生活 
 Now in the meantime, I have six friends who are waiting at the next six consecutive stops in their underwear as well. ||| 與此同時，我有6個朋友 喺接落嚟唧6個站，都凈喺著住底褲，等緊車 
 They're going to be entering this car one by one. ||| 然後逐一上車 
 We'll act as though we don't know each other. ||| 我哋會表現到唔識對方 
 And we'll act as if it's just an unfortunate mistake we've made, forgetting our pants on this cold January day. ||| 只喺咁啱大家都喺寒冬中唧一日 唔记得著褲 
 (Laughter) So at this point, she decides to put the rape book away. (Laughter) ||| （笑聲） 到咗而家 佢決定要將本強姦書擺埋一邊喇 （笑聲） 
 And she decides to be a little bit more aware of her surroundings. ||| 然後放多啲精力喺發生喺佢周圍唧事 
 Now in the meantime, the two Danish guys to the left of the camera, they're cracking up. ||| 同时，裹兩個坐喺攝影機旁邊唧丹麥男子 已經笑到停唔到喇 
 They think this is the funniest thing they've ever seen before. ||| 佢哋覺得我哋無著褲喺佢哋成世人見過最搞笑唧事 
 And watch her make eye contact with them right about now. ||| 留心睇下個女人，佢同個兩個男子有眼神交流喇 
 (Laughter) And I love that moment in this video, because before it became a shared experience, it was something that was maybe a little bit scary, or something that was at least confusing to her. ||| （笑聲） 依段片入邊，我最中意依嗰時刻 因為喺仲未同其他人有交流之前 個女人覺得我哋唧行為有啲得人驚 又或者佢會感到疑惑 
 And then once it became a shared experience, it was funny and something that she could laugh at. ||| 但喺當佢開始同其他人有交流之後 我哋无着裤就变成一件搞笑唧事喇 
 So the train is now pulling into the third stop along the 6 line. ||| 列车而家进入 6号线唧第三個站喇 
 (Laughter) So the video won't show everything. ||| （笑聲） 段片唔會播曬成個過程 
 This goes on for another four stops. ||| 到而家為止，後邊仲有四個站 
 A total of seven guys enter anonymously in their underwear. ||| 一共7個男人都好似我咁，凈喺著住底褲 
 At the eighth stop, a girl came in with a giant duffel bag and announced she had pants for sale for a dollar — like you might sell batteries or candy on the train. ||| 喺第八個站，有個女仔會帶住一個大帆布袋上車 然後對所有人講佢有長褲平賣，一蚊美金一條 好似其他人喺車上賣電池同糖一樣 
 "We all very matter of factly bought a pair of pants, put them on and said, ""Thank you. That's exactly what I needed today,"" and then exited without revealing what had happened and went in all different directions." ||| 我哋都買咗條褲，著上身之後 就對賣褲個女仔講：“太多謝你了。我今日就系爭依樣嘢。” 然後就一句解釋都唔咁落車 向住唔同唧方向離開 
 (Applause) Thank you. ||| （掌聲） 多謝 
 So that's a still from the video there. ||| 講返啱啱段片 
 And I love that girl's reaction so much. ||| 我實在太中意個女仔唧反應了 
 And watching that videotape later that day inspired me to keep doing what I do. ||| 嗰日後尾我睇返段片 啓發我要做多啲類似唧事 
 And really one of the points of Improv Everywhere is to cause a scene in a public place that is a positive experience for other people. ||| 爾“隨地即興”唧宗旨之一 就喺引起公眾關注 對其他人黎講都喺一個積極唧經歷 
 It's a prank, but it's a prank that gives somebody a great story to tell. ||| 我知喺有整蠱人唧感覺餓,但喺會喺一個好好唧故仔 
 And her reaction inspired me to do a second annual No Pants Subway Ride. ||| 個女人唧反應啓發咗我 舉辦第二屆“唔著褲坐地鐵” 
 And we've continued to do it every year. ||| 而且每年我哋都要有咁唧一日 
 This January, we did the 10th annual No Pants Subway Ride where a diverse group of 3,500 people rode the train in their underwear in New York — almost every single train line in the city. ||| 今年一月，喺“唔著褲坐地鐵”唧第十載 一共有3，500個嚟自唔同背景唧人 齋著住底褲，出現系紐約地鐵上 幾乎每一臺列車上都可以見到佢哋 
 And also in 50 other cities around the world, people participated. ||| 全球仲有50個城市唧人 都參與其中 
 (Laughter) As I started taking improv class at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater and meeting other creative people and other performers and comedians, I started amassing a mailing list of people who wanted to do these types of projects. ||| （笑聲） 我喺紐約一間劇院開始教授即興表演 識咗好多好有創意既人、演員同喜劇明星 我開始收集 對依類型演出有興趣唧人唧聯繫方式 
 So I could do more large-scale projects. ||| 擴大我啲表演唧規模 
 Well one day I was walking through Union Square, and I saw this building, which had just been built in 2005. ||| 有一日，我行過紐約聯合廣場 見到一棟樓 佢喺喺2005年建成唧 
 And there was a girl in one of the windows and she was dancing. ||| 有個女仔喺一個櫥窗入邊跳舞 
 And it was very peculiar, because it was dark out, but she was back-lit with florescent lighting, and she was very much onstage, and I couldn't figure out why she was doing it. ||| 望落好奇怪啦 因為周圍都好暗，得啲霓虹燈由後邊照住佢 好似佢就系舞臺上邊咁 我就諗唔通點解佢會做啲咁唧嘢 
 After about 15 seconds, her friend appeared — she had been hiding behind a display — and they laughed and hugged each other and ran away. ||| 約摸15秒之後，佢個朋友出現 個朋友之前一直匿喺展板後邊 佢哋狂笑，然後攬咗下對方之後跑住咁離開 
 So it seemed like maybe she had been dared to do this. ||| 我估就應該喺佢哋玩緊大冒險 
 So I got inspired by that. ||| 我都得到啓發啦 
 Looking at the entire facade — there were 70 total windows — and I knew what I had to do. ||| 望住棟樓，一共有70個咁既櫥窗 然後我就知道我要做啲咩啦 
 (Laughter) So this project is called Look Up More. We had 70 actors dress in black. ||| （笑聲） 依嗰計劃唧名叫做“多啲抬頭看”。我哋一共有70個人著到全身黑 
 This was completely unauthorized. ||| 未經過批准 
 We didn't let the stores know we were coming. ||| 因為我哋唔想比商場知道我哋要做依樣嘢 
 And I stood in the park giving signals. ||| 我就企喺公園度畀信號 
 "The first signal was for everybody to hold up these four-foot tall letters that spelled out ""Look Up More,"" the name of the project." ||| 第一個信號喺要所有人舉起一個四尺長唧字母 拼埋一起就喺“多啲抬頭看”唧英文 依次計劃唧名 
 The second signal was for everybody to do Jumping jacks together. ||| 第二個信號就喺要佢哋喺咁跳 
 You'll see that start right here. ||| 你哋可以見到喇 
 (Laughter) And then we had dancing. We had everyone dance. ||| （笑聲） 然後就開始跳舞，開頭喺各個人都跳 
 And then we had dance solos where only one person would dance and everybody would point to them. ||| 跟住落嚟就系獨舞 所有人都會指向裹個人唧方向 
 (Laughter) So then I gave a new hand signal, which signaled the next soloist down below in Forever 21, and he danced. ||| （笑聲） 然後我又畀出一個新信號 表示下一個獨舞唧喺喺某商店櫥窗唧裹個人 然後佢就開始跳 
 There were several other activities. ||| 仲有好多其他形式唧表演 
 We had people jumping up and down, people dropping to the ground. ||| 佢哋會上下跳 訓落地下 
 And I was standing just anonymously in a sweatshirt, putting my hand on and off of a trashcan to signal the advancement. ||| 我就著住件T恤，企喺人群中 用我只手同一個垃圾桶 黎畀信號 
 And because it was in Union Square Park, right by a subway station, there were hundreds of people by the end who stopped and looked up and watched what we were doing. ||| 因為地點喺喺聯合廣場公園，就喺地鐵站隔離 到咗最後，應該有幾百人 停低，抬起頭 睇我哋做緊乜 
 There's a better photo of it. ||| 仲有啲影得好啲唧相 
 So that particular event was inspired by a moment that I happened to stumble upon. ||| 依嗰計劃 只喺受到短短10幾秒唧啓發 仲要喺我咁啱撞到唧 
 The next project I want to show was given to me in an email from a stranger. ||| 下一個計劃我想要同你哋分享唧 喺有個我完全唔識唧人，喺2006年，發咗封電子郵件畀我 
 "A high school kid in Texas wrote me in 2006 and said, ""You should get as many people as possible to put on blue polo shirts and khaki pants and go into a Best Buy and stand around."" (Laughter) (Applause) So I wrote this high school kid back immediately, and I said, ""Yes, you are correct." ||| 佢喺美國德克薩斯州唧一個高中細路 佢話：“你應該嗌人，越多人越好 著住藍色polo恤衫，同啡色長褲 喺Best Buy(美國一間數碼商店）入邊企下。”（佢哋唧制服喺藍衫啡褲） （笑聲） （掌聲） 我即刻寫返封信畀個細路 話：“好！ 
 "I think I'll try to do that this weekend. Thank you."" So here's the video." ||| 我依個週末就試下！多謝！” 接落嚟就喺過日條片 
 So again, this is 2005. ||| 2005年 
 This is the Best Buy in New York City. ||| 喺紐約唧依間商場入邊 
 We had about 80 people show up to participate, entering one-by-one. ||| 一共有大概80個人參與依次計劃 佢哋一個個咁行入商場 
 There was an eight year-old girl, a 10 year-old girl. ||| 其中個8歲唧細路女，有個10歲唧細路女 
 There was also a 65 year-old man who participated. ||| 有個20歲唧細路女 仲有個65歲唧高齡男人 
 So a very diverse group of people. ||| 參與今次計劃唧真喺咩年齡都有 
 "And I told people, ""Don't work. Don't actually do work." ||| 我同啲人講：“唔好表現到你真喺喺裹度做嘢咁 
 But also, don't shop. ||| 但喺都唔好表現到你喺度行街 
 "Just stand around and don't face products."" Now you can see the regular employees by the ones that have the yellow tags on their shirt." ||| 就咁企喺度，不過唔好對住啲產品。” 而家你可以見到商場唧員工 佢哋件藍色恤衫上邊喺有個黃色牌唧 
 Everybody else is one of our actors. ||| 其他人都喺我哋計劃唧人 
 (Laughter) The lower level employees thought it was very funny. ||| （笑聲） 商場比較低層唧員工覺得我哋好搞笑 
 And in fact, several of them went to go get their camera from the break room and took photos with us. ||| 甚至有啲人由休息室入邊行出嚟，攞住部相機 要同我哋唧人合影 
 A lot of them made jokes about trying to get us to go to the back to get heavy television sets for customers. ||| 有啲人就想整蠱我哋，要我哋去倉庫 搬哋好重唧電視畀顧客 
 The managers and the security guards, on the other hand, did not find it particularly funny. ||| 不過，商場經理同保安 就唔覺得我哋搞笑喇 
 You can see them in this footage. ||| 喺依段片，你地可以見到 
 They're wearing either a yellow shirt or a black shirt. ||| 佢哋著住黃色或者黑色恤衫 
 And we were there probably 10 minutes before the managers decided to dial 911. ||| 我哋喺裹度大概有10分鐘 經理就決定要打911報警喇 
 (Laughter) So they started running around telling everybody the cops were coming, watch out, the cops were coming. ||| （笑聲） 然後我哋就開始周圍跑 通知其他人警察要嚟喇！睇住啊！警察要嚟喇！ 
 And you can see the cops in this footage right here. ||| 可以見到警察就喺裹度 
 That's a cop wearing black right there, being filmed with a hidden camera. ||| 著住黑色制服，畀人偷拍緊 
 Ultimately, the police had to inform Best Buy management that it was not, in fact, illegal to wear a blue polo shirt and khaki pants. ||| 最後，個警察同商場經理講 事實上，我哋唧行為唔犯法 無法律規定話唔比著藍色polo恤衫同緋色褲 
 (Laughter) (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) ||| （笑聲） （掌聲） 多謝 （掌聲） 
 So we had been there for 20 minutes; we were happy to exit the store. ||| 我哋喺商場入邊有20分鐘，然後好開心咁離開 
 One thing the managers were trying to do was to track down our cameras. ||| 個經理有嘗試 搵我哋唧偷拍攝影機 
 And they caught a couple of my guys who had hidden cameras in duffel bags. ||| 佢哋都捉到幾個我哋唧人放住臺偷拍攝影機喺帆布袋入邊 
 But the one camera guy they never caught was the guy that went in just with a blank tape and went over to the Best Buy camera department and just put his tape in one of their cameras and pretended to shop. ||| 但喺有一個人無畀人捉到 佢帶住個空帶入去商場 然後去到相機攝影機唧區域 將個空白帶放入商場唧相機 扮喺度試機 
 So I like that concept of using their own technology against them. ||| 我好中意依嗰諗法，用商場自己唧產品嚟影商場入邊發生唧事 
 (Laughter) I think our best projects are ones that are site specific and happen at a particular place for a reason. ||| （笑聲） 我覺得我哋最好唧喺喺特定場地 有特定原因唧計劃 
 And one morning, I was riding the subway. ||| 有一朝，我坐緊地鐵 
 I had to make a transfer at the 53rd St. stop where there are these two giant escalators. ||| 要系第三十五街站專線 裹個站有兩條超長唧電梯 
 And it's a very depressing place to be in the morning, it's very crowded. ||| 不過喺電梯上邊你會覺得好壓抑，而且喺依一個好多人唧早上 
 So I decided to try and stage something that could make it as happy as possible for one morning. ||| 我一我決定要喺度搞D乜嘢 可以令人覺得開心唧，雖然只喺一個早上 
 So this was in the winter of 2009 — 8:30 in the morning. ||| 然後系2009年冬天 有一朝喺八點半 
 It's morning rush hour. ||| 上班高峰期 
 It's very cold outside. ||| 室外好鬼凍 
 People are coming in from Queens, transferring from the E train to the 6 train. ||| 啲人都喺從皇后區坐過黎唧 由E號線轉過6號線 
 And they're going up these giant escalators on their way to their jobs. ||| 個個都坐緊依兩條超長唧電梯 喺佢哋返工唧路上 
 (Laughter) (Laughter) (Applause) Thank you. ||| （笑聲） （笑聲） （掌聲） 多謝 
 So there's a photograph that illustrates it a little bit better. ||| 依張向影得好啲 
 He gave 2,000 high fives that day, and he washed his hands before and afterward and did not get sick. ||| 佢裹日擊掌2000次 依嗰計劃前後佢都有洗手 所以無病倒 
 And that was done also without permission, although no one seemed to care. ||| 依次活動都喺無經過批准唧 不過好似都無人理 
 "So I'd say over the years, one of the most common criticisms I see of Improv Everywhere left anonymously on YouTube comments is: ""These people have too much time on their hands."" And you know, not everybody's going to like everything you do, and I've certainly developed a thick skin thanks to Internet comments, but that one's always bothered me, because we don't have too much time on our hands." ||| 依幾年 我見過喺網上匿名留言中 關於“隨地即興”最常見唧評論喺 “依班人實在太得閒了。” 唔喺個個人都會中意你做唧嘢 因為網上評論，我面皮都厚咗好多 但喺就喺放唔低依嗰人講唧嘢 因為講真我哋都好鬼唔得閑 
 The participants at Improv Everywhere events have just as much leisure time as any other New Yorkers, they just occasionally choose to spend it in an unusual way. ||| “隨地即興”唧人 同紐約市其他人一樣，都唔乜空餘時間 我哋只喺間中 選擇一種唔同唧方式嚟消磨時間 
 You know, every Saturday and Sunday, hundreds of thousands of people each fall gather in football stadiums to watch games. ||| 每年秋季唧每個週末 成千上萬人 聚埋喺足球場睇波 
 "And I've never seen anybody comment, looking at a football game, saying, ""All those people in the stands, they have too much time on their hands."" And of course they don't." ||| 點解我就唔見有人話啲睇波唧人 “裹啲喺足球場唧人實在太得閒喇！” 不過其實裹啲睇波人都好忙 
 It's a perfectly wonderful way to spent a weekend afternoon, watching a football game in a stadium. ||| 不過搵個週末下晝 喺足球場睇波，無乜嘢唔好 
 But I think it's also a perfectly valid way to spend an afternoon freezing in place with 200 people in the Grand Central terminal or dressing up like a ghostbuster and running through the New York Public Library. ||| 不過我覺得 搵日下晝，喺紐約中央車站 同200人一齊挨凍 或者著住《捉鬼敢死隊》唧制服 喺紐約公眾圖書館入邊跑嚟跑去 
 (Laughter) Or listening to the same MP3 as 3,000 other people and dancing silently in a park, or bursting into song in a grocery store as part of a spontaneous musical, or diving into the ocean in Coney Island wearing formal attire. ||| （笑聲） 或者同3000人一齊，喺公園入邊 用MP3同步停住同一首歌，一齊無聲咁跳舞 又或者為咗準備即興音樂劇 喺超市突然間開始唱歌 又或者一班人盛裝打扮，沖入個海度 
 You know, as kids, we're taught to play. ||| 細細個裹陣，大人都會教我哋點玩 
 And we're never given a reason why we should play. ||| 但喺佢哋都無話我哋知點解我哋要玩 
 It's just acceptable that play is a good thing. ||| 大家都好自然咁接受玩喺一件好事 
 And I think that's sort of the point of Improv Everywhere. ||| 依嗰就喺“隨地即興”想要傳達唧信息 
 It's that there is no point and that there doesn't have to be a point. ||| 玩無原因 
 We don't need a reason. ||| 我哋亦唔需要一個原因去玩 
 As long as it's fun and it seems like it's going to be a funny idea and it seems like the people who witness it will also have a fun time, then that's enough for us. ||| 只要件事好玩 個諗法睇落會好玩 同埋睇唧人開心 我哋就滿足了 
 And I think, as adults, we need to learn that there's no right or wrong way to play. ||| 作為成年人 我哋要識得諗話玩喺無最佳方式唧 
 Thank you very much. ||| 多謝 
 (Applause) ||| （掌聲） 
 Some people are obsessed by French wines. ||| 有啲人鍾意飲法國紅酒 
 Others love playing golf or devouring literature. ||| 而有啲人鍾意打哥爾夫球 或者埋頭睇書 
 Some cities are calmly industrious, like Dusseldorf or Louisville. ||| 有啲城市默默咁努力 比如話杜塞爾多夫 又或者路易斯維爾 
 Others project an energy that they can hardly contain, like New York or Hong Kong. ||| 有啲城市 比如話紐約 或者香港 
 And then you have Paris or Istanbul, and their patina full of history. ||| 然後仲有巴黎 或者伊斯坦布爾 同埋佢哋充滿歷史印記嘅一面 
 I see cities as living beings. ||| 我將城市睇成生物 
 And when I discover them from far above, I like to find those main streets and highways that structure their space. ||| 當我從高空探索佢哋 我鍾意搵建構空間嘅大馬路同高速公路 
 Especially at night, when commuters make these arteries look dramatically red and golden: the city's vascular system performing its vital function right before your eyes. ||| 尤其喺晚黑 當果啲上落班嘅人 城市嘅血管系統執行緊重要嘅任務 就喺你眼前 
 But when I'm sitting in my car after an hour and a half of commute every day, that reality looks very different. ||| 但係當我坐喺我部車入面 日日駕駛一個半鐘頭上落班之後 現實就好唔一樣啦 
 (Laughter) Nothing — not public radio, no podcast — (Laughter) Not even mindfulness meditation makes this time worth living. (Laughter) ||| （笑聲） 乜都無辦法 公共電台唔得 播客唔得 （笑聲） 甚至連冥想都冇辦法 令呢一段時間變得有意義 （笑聲） 
 Isn't it absurd that we created cars that can reach 130 miles per hour and we now drive them at the same speed as 19th-century horse carriages? (Laughter) ||| 唔覺得好可笑咩？ 我哋製造出時速可以達到 130 英里嘅車 然後以 19 世紀馬車嘅速度嚟開？ （笑聲） 
 In the US alone, we spent 29.6 billion hours commuting in 2014. ||| 凈係喺美國 2014 年，我哋就用咗296億個鐘上落班 
 With that amount of time, ancient Egyptians could have built 26 Pyramids of Giza. ||| 同樣嘅時間 古埃及人可以起 26 個吉薩金字塔 
 (Laughter) We do that in one year. ||| （笑聲） 我哋喺一年時間就用咗咁多個鐘 
 A monumental waste of time, energy and human potential. ||| 浪費大量嘅時間、能量同埋人類潜力 
 For decades, our remedy for congestion was simple: build new roads or enlarge existing ones. ||| 幾十年嚟 我哋應對塞車嘅措施都好簡單： 起一條新路或者擴闊現有嘅路 
 And it worked. ||| 呢個措施好有效 
 It worked admirably for Paris, when the city tore down hundreds of historical buildings to create 85 miles of transportation-friendly boulevards. ||| 喺巴黎相當之有效 巴黎拆咗幾百座歷史建築 嚟起 85 英里 方便運輸嘅林蔭大道 
 And it still works today in fast-growing emerging cities. ||| 呢個做法對宜家高速發展嘅新興城市 
 But in more established urban centers, significant network expansions are almost impossible: habitat is just too dense, real estate, too expensive and public finances, too fragile. ||| 但係喺更多發展完善嘅市中心裡面 大量嘅網絡擴張幾乎係唔可能嘅 住房建築太密集 房地產太貴 同埋公共財政太脆弱 
 Our city's vascular system is getting clogged, it's getting sick, and we should pay attention. ||| 我哋城市嘅血管系統塞住咗、病咗 而我哋應該多多關注 
 Our current way of thinking is not working. ||| 我哋目前嘅思考方式係唔掂嘅 
 For our transportation to flow, we need a new source of inspiration. ||| 為咗令我哋嘅交通順暢 我哋需要新嘅靈感源頭 
 "So after 16 years working in transportation, my ""aha moment"" happened when speaking with a biotech customer." ||| 喺運輸業做咗16年之後 當我同一個做生物科技嘅客人 
 She was telling me how her treatment was leveraging specific properties of our vascular system. ||| 佢同我講佢嘅療程 點利用血管系統裡面嘅某啲特性 
 It has been testing countless solutions to move nutrients, gases and proteins. ||| 血管系統試過無數解決方法 嚟運送營養、氣體同埋蛋白質 
 It really is the world's most sophisticated transportation laboratory. ||| 真係世界上最精密嘅運輸實驗室 
 So, what if the solution to our traffic challenges was inside us? ||| 如果解決交通需求嘅方法 就喺我哋體內呢？ 
 I wanted to know: Why is it that blood flows in our veins most of our lives, when our big cities get clogged on a daily basis? ||| 我想知 點解血液好平常咁喺血管流動 但係我哋嘅城市就日日塞車？ 
 And the reality is that you're looking at two very different networks. ||| 事實上你係睇緊兩個非常唔同嘅網絡 
 I don't know if you realize, but each of us has 60,000 miles of blood vessels in our bodies — 60,000 miles. ||| 唔知你有冇意識到 我哋每個人體內都有六萬英里長嘅血管 有六萬英里 
 What it means is that blood vessels are everywhere inside us, not just under the surface of our skin. ||| 亦即係話我哋體內周圍都係血管 唔只係喺我哋皮膚表層嘅下面 
 But if you look at our cities, yes, we have some underground subway systems and some tunnels and bridges, and also some helicopters in the sky. ||| 但係當你望向我哋嘅城市 冇錯，我哋係有地鐵系統 有隧道同橋樑 仲有天上嘅直升機 
 But the vast majority of our traffic is focused on the ground, on the surface. ||| 但係大部分嘅交通都集中喺地面 喺表層 
 So in other words, while our vascular system uses the three dimensions inside us, our urban transportation is mostly two-dimensional. ||| 即係話 我哋體內嘅血管系統係立體 而市區運輸系統基本上係平面 
 And so what we need is to embrace that verticality. ||| 所以我哋應該將天空納入運輸系統 
 If our surface grid is saturated, well, let's elevate our traffic. ||| 如果我哋嘅平面飽和咗 咁就將交通升高 
 And we can keep climbing, and fly. ||| 我哋可以繼續攀爬，飛天 
 The fact that a company like Airbus is now seriously working on flying urban taxis is telling us something. ||| 事實上好似空中巴士呢種公司 宜家認真咁研究市區空中的士 講明咗一啲事 
 Flying cars are finally moving from science-fiction déjà vu to attractive business-case territory. ||| 飛天汽車終於從科幻 轉移到吸引嘅商業範疇 
 And that's an exciting moment. ||| 呢一刻好令人興奮 
 So building this 3-D transportation network is one of the ways we can mitigate and solve traffic jams. ||| 所以起呢個 3D 運輸網絡 係緩和並且解決塞車嘅方法之一 
 But it's not the only one. ||| 但唔係唯一嘅方法 
 We have to question other fundamental choices that we made, like the vehicles we use. ||| 我哋必須質疑 我哋其他嘅根本性選擇 
 Just imagine a very familiar scene: You've been driving for 42 minutes. ||| 想象一下一個好熟悉嘅場景： 你已經開咗 42 分鐘車 
 The two kids behind you are getting restless. ||| 你後面嘅兩個細路仔開始煩躁 
 And you're late. ||| 而你已經遲到 
 Do you see that slow car in front of you? ||| 見唔見到前面果部開得好慢嘅車？ 
 Always comes when you're late, right? ||| 呢種事成日發生係你遲到嘅時候 
 There is no parking spot available in the area, but how would he know? ||| 果度附近冇空位 但係佢點知呢？ 
 Do you see the 100 cars around you? ||| 見唔見到你身邊嘅 100 部車？ 
 Eighty-five of them only have one passenger. ||| 其中 85 部車入面只有一個乘客 
 Those 85 drivers could all fit in one Londonian red bus. ||| 呢 85 位司機可以坐滿一部倫敦紅巴士 
 Biology would never do this. ||| 生物學永遠唔會咁做 
 Space inside our arteries is fully utilized. ||| 我哋充分利用咗血管裡面嘅空間 
 At every heartbeat, a higher blood pressure literally compacts millions of red blood cells into massive trains of oxygen that quickly flow throughout our body. ||| 每一下心跳 高血壓就壓迫幾百萬個紅血球 進入龐大嘅氧氣火車裡面 好快咁係我哋人體內流通 
 And the tiny space inside our red blood cells is not wasted, either. ||| 而紅血球裡面嘅小空間亦冇浪費 
 In healthy conditions, more than 95 percent of their oxygen capacity is utilized. ||| 喺健康嘅情况下 最少會用到 95% 嘅氧氣容量 
 The reason blood is so incredibly efficient is that our red blood cells are not dedicated to specific organs or tissues; otherwise, we would probably have traffic jams in our veins. ||| 血液之所以咁高效率 係因為我哋嘅紅血球並唔係只用喺 特定嘅器官同組織 如果唔係，我哋嘅血管可能會塞車 
 No, they're shared. ||| 紅血球係共享嘅 
 They're shared by all the cells of our body. ||| 係我哋體內所有細胞共享嘅 
 And because our network is so extensive, each one of our 37 trillion cells gets its own deliveries of oxygen precisely when it needs them. ||| 因為我哋嘅網絡咁龐大 37 兆個細胞，每一個都運送氧氣 啱啱好係需要嘅時候 
 Blood is both a collective and individual form of transportation. ||| 血液係一種既集體又獨立嘅傳輸方式 
 But for our cities, we've been stuck. ||| 但係對我哋嘅城市嚟講 我哋塞住咗 
 We've been stuck in an endless debate between creating a car-centric society or extensive mass-transit systems. ||| 我哋塞喺無止境嘅辯論裡面 辯論建立以車為中心嘅社會 
 I think we should transcend this. ||| 我覺得我哋應該更進一步 
 I think we can create vehicles that combine the convenience of cars and the efficiencies of trains and buses. ||| 我覺得我哋可以發明一啲交通工具 同埋火車同巴士嘅高效率 
 Just imagine. ||| 想象一下 
 The problem with urban trains is that sometimes you have to stop five, ten, fifteen times before your final destination. ||| 城市火車嘅問題係 喺到達最終目的地之前 有時要停靠 5 次、10 次、15 次 
 What if in this train you didn't have to stop? ||| 如果呢部火車係不需要停靠呢？ 
 In this train, wagons can detach dynamically while you're moving and become express, driverless buses that move on a secondary road network. ||| 當你喺路上嘅時候 呢部火車嘅車廂可以動態分離 變成快車、無人駕駛嘅巴士 喺細啲嘅馬路上行駛 
 And so without a single stop, nor a lengthy transfer, you are now sitting in a bus that is headed toward your suburb. ||| 所以完全唔使停靠 亦唔會有漫長嘅轉車 你宜家坐喺一部開往郊區嘅巴士上 
 And when you get close, the section you're sitting in detaches and self-drives you right to your doorstep. ||| 就嚟到嘅時候 你坐嘅果部分會脫離 自動將你送到目的地 
 It is collective and individual at the same time. ||| 既集體又獨立 
 This could be one of the shared, modular, driverless vehicles of tomorrow. ||| 呢個係共享、組合式 
 Now ... ||| 宜家…… 
 as if walking in a city buzzing with drones, flying taxis, modular buses and suspended magnetic pods was not exotic enough, I think there is another force in action that will make urban traffic mesmerizing. ||| 就好似喺城市行走，有無人機 空中的士、組合式巴士同埋磁懸浮車艙 都仲未夠神奇 我覺得仲有另外一種力量喺度努力緊 令巿區交通變得更有魅力 
 If you think about it, the current generation of driverless cars is just trying to earn its way into a traffic grid made by and for humans. ||| 你諗下 宜家嘅無人駕駛車輛諗緊辦法 進入由人製造、為人服務嘅 交通網絡裡面 
 They're trying to learn traffic rules, which is relatively simple, and coping with human unpredictability, which is more challenging. ||| 佢哋嘗試學習交通規則 更有挑戰性嘅係 佢哋仲要應對人類嘅不可預測性 
 But what would happen when whole cities become driverless? ||| 但係當成個城市變成 
 Would we need traffic lights? ||| 我哋仲需唔需要紅綠燈？ 
 Would we need lanes? ||| 仲需唔需要車道？ 
 How about speed limits? ||| 速度限制呢？ 
 Red blood cells are not flowing in lanes. ||| 紅血球唔係喺車道上面流通嘅 
 They never stop at red lights. ||| 佢哋從來都唔會因為紅燈而停 
 In the first driverless cities, you would have no red lights and no lanes. ||| 係第一批無人駕駛嘅城市裡面 唔會有紅燈同埋車道 
 And when all the cars are driverless and connected, everything is predictable and reaction time, minimum. ||| 當所有車都係無人駕駛而且連埋一齊 一切都可以預測，反應時間都係最短 
 They can drive much faster and can take any rational initiative that can speed them up or the cars around them. ||| 無人駕駛車可以開得更加快 可以採取任何合理嘅行為嚟加快速度 或者加快旁邊其他車嘅速度 
 The result: a strange traffic that mixes the fast and smooth rigor of German autobahns and the creative vitality of the intersections of Mumbai. ||| 結果就係，奇怪嘅交通系統 融合咗德國高速公路嘅快同穩 同埋孟買十字路口嘅創意活力 
 (Laughter) Traffic will be functionally exuberant. ||| （笑聲） 交通功能將會非常豐富 
 It will be liquid like our blood. ||| 會好似血液咁流動 
 And by a strange paradox, the more robotized our traffic grid will be, the more organic and alive its movement will feel. ||| 根據一個奇怪嘅悖論 交通網絡越係自動化 佢嘅流動就越統一而且充滿活力 
 So yes, biology has all the attributes of a transportation genius today. ||| 所以，冇錯 生物學有嗮所有 
 But this process has taken billions of years, and went through all sorts of iterations and mutations. ||| 但呢個過程已經喺幾十億年前開始 而且經歷咗好多次嘅反覆同變異 
 We can't wait billions of years to evolve our transportation system. ||| 我哋唔可以等幾十億年 
 We now have the dreams, the concepts and the technology to create 3-D transportation networks, invent new vehicles and change the flow in our cities. ||| 宜家我哋有夢想 有概念 有技術 嚟起一個 3D 運輸網絡 發明新嘅交通工具 同改變我哋城市嘅流動 
 Let's do it. ||| 一起行動啦 
 Thank you. ||| 多謝 
 (Applause) ||| （鼓掌） 
 So I'd like you to imagine for a moment that you're a soldier in the heat of battle. ||| 請大家想像下 自己係個打緊仗嘅士兵 
 Maybe you're a Roman foot soldier or a medieval archer or maybe you're a Zulu warrior. ||| 可能係個羅馬步兵 或者係中世紀嘅弓箭手 又或者係祖魯戰士 
 Regardless of your time and place, there are some things that are constant. ||| 無論你身處何時何地 有啲嘢係唔會變嘅 
 Your adrenaline is elevated, and your actions are stemming from these deeply ingrained reflexes, reflexes rooted in a need to protect yourself and your side and to defeat the enemy. ||| 你嘅腎上腺素會升高 你嘅行為，其實根植於 呢啲反射動作之中 呢啲用黎保護你自己 同埋打敗敵人嘅反射動作 
 So now, I'd like you to imagine playing a very different role, that of the scout. ||| 所以依家我希望 你哋諗下喺頭先嘅情境中 自己扮演唔同嘅角色：偵察兵 
 The scout's job is not to attack or defend. ||| 偵察兵唔洗攻擊或者防禦 
 The scout's job is to understand. ||| 任務只係要了解情況 
 The scout is the one going out, mapping the terrain, identifying potential obstacles. ||| 偵察兵要行出去 畫出敵方嘅地圖 了解潛在嘅阻礙物 
 And the scout may hope to learn that, say, there's a bridge in a convenient location across a river. ||| 偵察兵希望了解嘅係譬如 一個方便過河嘅位置 係唔係有一座橋 
 But above all, the scout wants to know what's really there, as accurately as possible. ||| 不過更加重要嘅係，偵察兵希望 了解嗰度究竟有啲咩 知得越精確越好 
 And in a real, actual army, both the soldier and the scout are essential. ||| 正如真正嘅軍隊入面 士兵同偵察兵都好重要 
 But you can also think of each of these roles as a mindset — a metaphor for how all of us process information and ideas in our daily lives. ||| 不過你又可以當呢啲 角色代表緊啲思維方式 比喻緊我哋喺日常生活之中 接收信息同諗嘢嘅過程 
 What I'm going to argue today is that having good judgment, making accurate predictions, making good decisions, is mostly about which mindset you're in. ||| 我哋今日想講嘅就係 要擁有優秀嘅判斷力 要作出精確嘅預測、正確嘅決定 主要取決於你嘅思維方式 
 To illustrate these mindsets in action, I'm going to take you back to 19th-century France, where this innocuous-looking piece of paper launched one of the biggest political scandals in history. ||| 依家我哋可以實際 展示下呢種思維方式 我會帶住你地去 十九世紀嘅法國 喺嗰度，呢張睇落微不足道嘅紙仔 引發咗歷史上 數一數二嘅政治醜聞 
 It was discovered in 1894 by officers in the French general staff. ||| 1894 年，有啲法國公務員發現 
 It was torn up in a wastepaper basket, but when they pieced it back together, they discovered that someone in their ranks had been selling military secrets to Germany. ||| 垃圾桶裡面一張撕碎嘅紙 將啲紙砌返埋之後 佢哋發現隊伍裡面有人 偷偷地賣軍事機密畀德國 
 So they launched a big investigation, and their suspicions quickly converged on this man, Alfred Dreyfus. ||| 於是佢哋開始咗個大規模嘅調查 調查結果好快指向一個人 阿弗列 ‧ 屈里弗斯 
 He had a sterling record, no past history of wrongdoing, no motive as far as they could tell. ||| 佢嘅信用紀錄幾好 之前無做錯過嘢 又唔似有犯案動機 
 But Dreyfus was the only Jewish officer at that rank in the army, and unfortunately at this time, the French Army was highly anti-Semitic. ||| 但係，屈里弗斯係隊伍 入面唯一一個猶太軍官 不幸嘅係，嗰時法國軍隊好歧視猶太人 
 They compared Dreyfus's handwriting to that on the memo and concluded that it was a match, even though outside professional handwriting experts were much less confident in the similarity, but never mind that. ||| 佢哋攞屈里弗斯嘅字跡同嗰張紙做比較 發現係一致嘅 雖然其他筆跡專家 覺得冇咁似 但係無論點 
 They went and searched Dreyfus's apartment, looking for any signs of espionage. ||| 佢哋去咗屈里弗斯間屋 搵佢做間諜嘅痕跡 
 This just convinced them more that Dreyfus was not only guilty, but sneaky as well, because clearly he had hidden all of the evidence before they had managed to get to it. ||| 佢哋反而覺得屈里弗斯一定係做緊間諜 仲超級狡猾，係佢哋嚟到之前 已經將啲罪證收起曬 
 Next, they went and looked through his personal history for any incriminating details. ||| 跟著落嚟，佢哋去查佢嘅個人歷史 試圖尋找犯罪嘅痕跡 
 You know, because a spy has to remember a lot of things. ||| 因為你知啦 間諜係需要記住好多嘢㗎嘛 
 So the case went to trial, and Dreyfus was found guilty. ||| 呢單案件上咗法庭 屈里弗斯被判有罪 
 Afterwards, they took him out into this public square and ritualistically tore his insignia from his uniform and broke his sword in two. ||| 之後，佢哋將佢帶到廣場上 依足規矩咁扯走佢嘅徽章 又將佢嘅劍折成兩段 
 This was called the Degradation of Dreyfus. ||| 呢個就係屈里弗斯降級事件 
 And they sentenced him to life imprisonment on the aptly named Devil's Island, which is this barren rock off the coast of South America. ||| 佢哋判咗佢終身監禁 將佢流放到南美洲海岸 一個叫做魔鬼島嘅荒涼小島上 
 So there he went, and there he spent his days alone, writing letters and letters to the French government begging them to reopen his case so they could discover his innocence. ||| 佢之後就去咗嗰度淒涼度日 寫左一封又一封信畀法國政府 求佢哋重新審過單案時 會察覺佢係無辜嘅 
 But for the most part, France considered the matter closed. ||| 但係大家都覺得 呢單案已經完曬 
 One thing that's really interesting to me about the Dreyfus Affair is this question of why the officers were so convinced that Dreyfus was guilty. ||| 我覺得屈里弗斯事件 好有意思嘅一個地方 就係嗰啲官員點解咁肯定 屈里弗斯係有罪嘅呢 
 I mean, you might even assume that they were setting him up, that they were intentionally framing him. ||| 你甚至會覺得 佢地設佢局 特登陷害佢 
 But historians don't think that's what happened. ||| 不過歷史學家都唔係咁諗 
 As far as we can tell, the officers genuinely believed that the case against Dreyfus was strong. ||| 我哋可以睇到 個啲官真係覺得 控訴屈里弗斯嘅理據十足 
 Which makes you wonder: What does it say about the human mind that we can find such paltry evidence to be compelling enough to convict a man? ||| 呢件事令人奇怪 人類個腦到底有咩問題 以至咁丁點嘅證據 都可以說服到人判佢有罪？ 
 "Well, this is a case of what scientists call ""motivated reasoning."" It's this phenomenon in which our unconscious motivations, our desires and fears, shape the way we interpret information." ||| 係咁嘅，科學家發現一種 叫做「動機性推理」嘅現象 係指我哋嘅潛意識 我哋嘅慾望同恐懼 塑造咗我哋分析信息嘅方式 
 Some information, some ideas, feel like our allies. ||| 有啲信息，有啲諗法 對我哋嚟講好似朋友 
 We want them to win. We want to defend them. ||| 我哋想佢地贏 我哋想護住佢哋 
 And other information or ideas are the enemy, and we want to shoot them down. ||| 有啲信息好似仇人咁樣 我哋想消滅佢哋 
 "So this is why I call motivated reasoning, ""soldier mindset."" Probably most of you have never persecuted a French-Jewish officer for high treason, I assume, but maybe you've followed sports or politics, so you might have noticed that when the referee judges that your team committed a foul, for example, you're highly motivated to find reasons why he's wrong." ||| 所以我鐘意叫動機性推理 做「士兵思維」 你哋就從未迫害過 猶太裔法國軍官，話佢係叛徒 我估係呱 不過你如果鍾意睇體育 或者政治新聞 譬如，當個裁判話 你鍾意嗰隊犯規 你就會好想搵理由講 佢點解判錯咗 
 But if he judges that the other team committed a foul — awesome! ||| 不過如果佢判另外嗰隊 犯咗規，你就會覺得好啱 
 That's a good call, let's not examine it too closely. ||| 這個例子幾好 但大家唔好咁認真 
 Or, maybe you've read an article or a study that examined some controversial policy, like capital punishment. ||| 或者，你可能啱啱先讀咗一篇 有關一啲爭議嘅文章或者研究 譬如應唔應該有死刑 
 And, as researchers have demonstrated, if you support capital punishment and the study shows that it's not effective, then you're highly motivated to find all the reasons why the study was poorly designed. ||| 啲研究員發現 如果你支持死刑 但係篇文話死刑無用嘅話 你就會好想搵出 呢份報告邊度寫得唔好 
 But if it shows that capital punishment works, it's a good study. ||| 不過如果篇文支持死刑 你就會覺得佢寫得好好 
 And vice versa: if you don't support capital punishment, same thing. ||| 反之亦然：如果你唔 支持死刑，都係一樣嘅 
 Our judgment is strongly influenced, unconsciously, by which side we want to win. ||| 我哋嘅判斷力喺無意之中 受我哋嘅立場好大影響 
 And this is ubiquitous. ||| 呢個現象好普遍 
 This shapes how we think about our health, our relationships, how we decide how to vote, what we consider fair or ethical. ||| 決定緊我哋點睇 健康同人際關係 點投票 點先覺得係公平或者合乎道德 
 What's most scary to me about motivated reasoning or soldier mindset, is how unconscious it is. ||| 最驚嚇嘅係 動機性推理或者士兵思維 都係完全無意嘅 
 We can think we're being objective and fair-minded and still wind up ruining the life of an innocent man. ||| 我哋以為自己好公正、好客觀 但係都可以冤死無辜嘅人 
 However, fortunately for Dreyfus, his story is not over. ||| 不過，好彩屈里弗斯嘅故事未完 
 This is Colonel Picquart. ||| 呢個係皮卡爾上校 
 He's another high-ranking officer in the French Army, and like most people, he assumed Dreyfus was guilty. ||| 佢係另外一個法軍高官 同其他人一樣，佢都覺得屈里弗斯有罪 
 Also like most people in the army, he was at least casually anti-Semitic. ||| 又同其他人咁，佢都有少少反猶太 
 "But at a certain point, Picquart began to suspect: "What if we're all wrong about Dreyfus?"" ||| 不過，過咗一段時間，皮卡爾開始懷疑 「我哋係唔係冤枉咗屈里弗斯？」 
 What happened was, he had discovered evidence that the spying for Germany had continued, even after Dreyfus was in prison. ||| 之後，佢發現 屈里弗斯坐緊監時 都繼續有人為德國通風報信 
 And he had also discovered that another officer in the army had handwriting that perfectly matched the memo, much closer than Dreyfus's handwriting. ||| 佢仲發現軍隊入面 有人嘅字跡同果張紙仔上嘅一模一樣 而且比起屈里弗斯嘅字跡更加似 
 "So he brought these discoveries to his superiors, but to his dismay, they either didn't care or came up with elaborate rationalizations to explain his findings, like, ""Well, all you've really shown, Picquart, is that there's another spy who learned how to mimic Dreyfus's handwriting, and he picked up the torch of spying after Dreyfus left." ||| 於是，佢向上級匯報佢嘅發現 不過令佢失望嘅係，佢哋一係就唔上心 一係就兜個大圈，合理化啲新發現 譬如「皮卡爾，你只不過 發現咗另一個間諜 模仿咗屈里弗斯嘅字跡。 喺屈里弗斯坐監之後接手間諜工作。 
 "But Dreyfus is still guilty."" Eventually, Picquart managed to get Dreyfus exonerated." ||| 不過屈里弗斯都係有罪嘅。」 最尾，皮卡爾成功幫屈里弗斯洗脫罪名 
 But it took him 10 years, and for part of that time, he himself was in prison for the crime of disloyalty to the army. ||| 但係就用咗整整十年 期間佢自己都因為 對軍隊不忠坐咗陣監 
 A lot of people feel like Picquart can't really be the hero of this story because he was an anti-Semite and that's bad, which I agree with. ||| 好多人覺得皮卡爾唔係成件事嘅英雄 因為佢都歧視猶太人，我同意呢點 
 "So to me, Picquart is a poster child for what I call ""scout mindset."" It's the drive not to make one idea win or another lose, but just to see what's really there as honestly and accurately as you can, even if it's not pretty or convenient or pleasant." ||| 對於我嚟講 皮卡爾係「偵察思維」嘅典範 冇支持或反對任何觀點 而係純粹發現事實所在 盡量真實準確嘅事實 即使啲事實唔光彩、唔方便人 唔討人歡喜 
 This mindset is what I'm personally passionate about. ||| 呢個就係我熱愛嘅思維 
 And I've spent the last few years examining and trying to figure out what causes scout mindset. ||| 過去幾年，我試圖探索同發現 「偵察思維」係點樣形成嘅 
 Why are some people, sometimes at least, able to cut through their own prejudices and biases and motivations and just try to see the facts and the evidence as objectively as they can? ||| 點解有啲人，有啲時候 能夠摒棄自己嘅偏見、主觀同埋動機 嘗試用最客觀嘅眼光 去睇清事實同證據 
 And the answer is emotional. ||| 答案就係情感上 
 It's just rooted in different emotions. ||| 不過係出於唔同嘅情感 
 For example, scouts are curious. ||| 譬如，偵察者有好奇心 
 They're more likely to say they feel pleasure when they learn new information or an itch to solve a puzzle. ||| 佢哋學到新嘢時 或者解開難題時 就會好開心 
 Scouts also have different values. ||| 偵察者都有唔同嘅價值觀 
 They're more likely to say they think it's virtuous to test your own beliefs, and they're less likely to say that someone who changes his mind seems weak. ||| 佢哋覺得驗證自己嘅觀念 係一種美德 而唔會覺得 改變諗法係一種軟弱嘅行為 
 So they can believe that capital punishment works. ||| 佢哋可能覺得死刑係有用嘅 
 "If studies come out showing that it doesn't, they can say, "Huh. Looks like I might be wrong. Doesn't mean I'm bad or stupid."" ||| 但如果有研究話死刑係冇用嘅 佢哋會諗「係，我諗錯咗， 但都唔代表我差勁或者蠢」 
 And the key takeaway I want to leave you with about those traits is that they're primarily not about how smart you are or about how much you know. ||| 我最想比你知道嘅就係 係呢啲性格特點同你醒唔醒無關 同你識幾多嘢都無關 
 In fact, they don't correlate very much with IQ at all. ||| 其實同智商都冇咩數據上嘅關係 
 They're about how you feel. ||| 主要都係同情感有關 
 There's a quote that I keep coming back to, by Saint-Exupéry. ||| 我成日引用聖埃克絮佩里 
 "He's the author of ""The Little Prince."" He said, ""If you want to build a ship, don't drum up your men to collect wood and give orders and distribute the work." ||| ——即係《小王子》嘅作者所講 「如果你想造船， 唔好叫人地收集木頭、發號施令、 分配工作， 
 "Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea."" In other words, I claim, if we really want to improve our judgment as individuals and as societies, what we need most is not more instruction in logic or rhetoric or probability or economics, even though those things are quite valuable." ||| 而係要教識佢哋嚮往 無邊無際嘅大海。」 換句話講 如果我哋真係想改善判斷能力 不論係作為係個人或者社會 我哋最需要嘅唔係更多嘅邏輯構建 比喻、機會率又或經濟學 儘管呢啲嘢都好有價值 
 We need to change the way we feel. ||| 我哋需要改變自己嘅感觀 
 We need to learn how to feel proud instead of ashamed when we notice we might have been wrong about something. ||| 我哋需要學習 喺發現自己諗錯嘢時 覺得自豪而唔係羞恥 
 We need to learn how to feel intrigued instead of defensive when we encounter some information that contradicts our beliefs. ||| 需要學習如何喺發現一啲 同我哋觀念牴觸嘅資訊時 覺得好奇而唔係戒備 
 So the question I want to leave you with is: What do you most yearn for? ||| 所以，我想問你哋嘅問題係 你最想要嘅係咩？ 
 Do you yearn to defend your own beliefs? ||| 你想防禦自己嘅觀念？ 
 Or do you yearn to see the world as clearly as you possibly can? ||| 定係想盡可能睇到真實嘅世界？ 
 Thank you. ||| 多謝各位 
 I consider it my life's mission to convey the urgency of climate change through my work. ||| 我將一件事當成我一生嘅使命 就係用我作品傳達氣候變化嘅急切性 
 I choose to convey the beauty as opposed to the devastation. ||| 我選擇要傳達美感，而唔係破壞 
 Drawing is a form of meditation for me. ||| 對我嚟說，畫畫係冥想嘅一種形式 
 It quiets my mind. ||| 令我思緒安靜落黎 
 My mother was originally supposed to lead this trip. ||| 呢次行程原本由我母親帶 
 The ice fields are alive with movement and sound in a way that I never expected. ||| 冰原有生命 係我從來無想像過嘅 
 My drawings celebrate the beauty of what we all stand to lose. ||| 而我嘅畫，都會讚頌 我哋大家都會失去嘅美 
 Thank you. ||| 多謝 
 I'm a pediatrician and an anesthesiologist, so I put children to sleep for a living. ||| 我係一名小兒科醫師亦係麻醉師， 我靠催眠D細路賺錢謀生。 
 (Laughter) And I'm an academic, so I put audiences to sleep for free. (Laughter) ||| （笑聲） 我仲係一名學者，我可以唔使錢催眠聽眾。 （笑聲） 
 But what I actually mostly do is I manage the pain management service at the Packard Children's Hospital up at Stanford in Palo Alto. ||| 但事實上我最做得最多嘅 係喺帕洛阿爾托市斯坦福帕卡德兒童醫院 進行痛楚管理。 
 And it's from the experience from about 20 or 25 years of doing that that I want to bring to you the message this morning, that pain is a disease. ||| 喺果度嘅 有20至25年經驗 今日我想話比你地聽， 痛楚係一種疾病。 
 Now most of the time, you think of pain as a symptom of a disease, and that's true most of the time. ||| 大多数情况， 你將痛楚睇成疾病嘅一種症狀。 好多時候都係啱嘅。 
 It's the symptom of a tumor or an infection or an inflammation or an operation. ||| 佢可以係腫瘤或某種感染 或者係某種炎症亦或者係手術嘅症狀。 
 But about 10 percent of the time, after the patient has recovered from one of those events, pain persists. ||| 但係有大概10%嘅情况， 患者從以上所講嘅情況恢復之後， 痛楚仍然持續。 
 It persists for months and oftentimes for years, and when that happens, it is its own disease. ||| 而且持續好幾個月, 好多時仲係幾年。 哩種情況發生果陣， 佢就係疾病。 
 And before I tell you about how it is that we think that happens and what we can do about it, I want to show you how it feels for my patients. ||| 喺我講比你地聽佢點樣產生之前 以及我地可以點做之前， 我想同你地講下我D病人嘅感受。 
 So imagine, if you will, that I'm stroking your arm with this feather, as I'm stroking my arm right now. ||| 如果可以，請你地想像一吓， 我用哩條羽毛掃你你嘅手臂， 就好似兒家我就掃緊自己。 
 Now, I want you to imagine that I'm stroking it with this. ||| 請你地兒家開​​始想像吓 我用佢掃過哩度。 
 Please keep your seat. ||| 大家坐好D啊 
 (Laughter) A very different feeling. ||| （笑聲） 好唔同嘅感覺。 
 Now what does it have to do with chronic pain? ||| 咁樣同慢性痛楚有咩關係呢？ 
 Imagine, if you will, these two ideas together. ||| 想像吓，如果你將哩兩個想法混埋一齊。 
 Imagine what your life would be like if I were to stroke it with this feather, but your brain was telling you that this is what you are feeling — and that is the experience of my patients with chronic pain. ||| 想像你嘅生活會系點 如果我用羽毛掃過呢度， 但係你嘅大腦會話比你聽 哩個就係你嘅感覺 哩個就係我哥個慢性痛楚病人嘅經歷。 
 In fact, imagine something even worse. ||| 事實上，試想像某些更壞嘅事情。 
 Imagine I were to stroke your child's arm with this feather, and their brain [was] telling them that they were feeling this hot torch. ||| 想像我用羽毛掃過你細路嘅手臂， 佢地嘅大腦會話比佢地聽 佢地感覺到哩把高溫火焰。 
 That was the experience of my patient, Chandler, whom you see in the photograph. ||| 哩個就係我個病人Chandler嘅經歷， 哩張係佢幅相。 
 As you can see, she's a beautiful, young woman. ||| 你地見到佢係一個靚女。 
 She was 16 years old last year when I met her, and she aspired to be a professional dancer. ||| 我識佢果陣佢先至16歲， 佢渴望成為一位職業舞蹈員。 
 And during the course of one of her dance rehearsals, she fell on her outstretched arm and sprained her wrist. ||| 喺佢一次舞蹈排練嘅過程中， 佢跌親壓住咗伸出嘅手臂，跟住扭親埋手腕 
 Now you would probably imagine, as she did, that a wrist sprain is a trivial event in a person's life. ||| 兒家你地大概可以想象就好似佢感， 扭傷手腕喺人生中 只不過係件小事。 
 Wrap it in an ACE bandage, take some ibuprofen for a week or two, and that's the end of the story. ||| 只需用ACE繃帶包紮吓， 只食一到兩個星期嘅布洛芬止痛藥, 就無乜事喇。 
 But in Chandler's case, that was the beginning of the story. ||| 不過喺Chandler嘅病例中，服藥只係故事嘅開始。 
 This is what her arm looked like when she came to my clinic about three months after her sprain. ||| 哩個係佢手臂嘅樣 佢扭傷咗大概3個星期後先來穩我。 
 You can see that the arm is discolored, purplish in color. ||| 你地可以睇到佢嘅手臂， 已經褪色同埋發紫。 
 It was cadaverically cold to the touch. ||| 摸上去好似屍體咁凍。 
 The muscles were frozen, paralyzed — dystonic is how we refer to that. ||| 肌肉僵硬、麻痹、 張力障礙。 
 The pain had spread from her wrist to her hands, to her fingertips, from her wrist up to her elbow, almost all the way to her shoulder. ||| 痛楚從腕部擴展到手， 再到手指，痛楚從手腕擴展到肘部， 甚至幾乎到左肩部。 
 But the worst part was, not the spontaneous pain that was there 24 hours a day. ||| 最惨嘅係， 並唔係自發嘅整日痛楚。 
 The worst part was that she had allodynia, the medical term for the phenomenon that I just illustrated with the feather and with the torch. ||| 最慘嘅系佢掂下野就會痛， 醫學上叫觸痛 同剛才羽毛、高溫火焰一樣。 
 The lightest touch of her arm — the touch of a hand, the touch even of a sleeve, of a garment, as she put it on — caused excruciating, burning pain. ||| 輕輕觸摸佢嘅手臂、 手， 甚至係衣袖 都會引發劇烈的、燒灼般嘅痛苦。 
 How can the nervous system get this so wrong? How can the nervous system ||| 神經系統系點解會錯成咁樣？ 點解神經系統 
 misinterpret an innocent sensation like the touch of a hand and turn it into the malevolent sensation of the touch of the flame? ||| 誤解咗一個無辜嘅知覺 就好似摸佢隻手 會變成惡毒嘅知覺 火焰燒灼般嘅觸覺。 
 Well you probably imagine that the nervous system in the body is hardwired like your house. ||| 你大概可以想像機體中嘅神經系統 就好似你屋企裡面嘅導​​線。 
 In your house, wires run in the wall, from the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling and from the junction box to the light bulb. ||| 在屋企裡面，導線佈滿牆壁， 從開關制到天花板嘅連接盒 從連接盒到燈泡。 
 And when you turn the switch on, the light goes on. ||| 當你開開關制，燈就著。 
 And when you turn the switch off, the light goes off. ||| 當你關閉開關制，燈就熄。 
 So people imagine the nervous system is just like that. ||| 就用咁嘅方式想像神經系統。 
 If you hit your thumb with a hammer, these wires in your arm — that, of course, we call nerves — transmit the information into the junction box in the spinal cord where new wires, new nerves, take the information up to the brain where you become consciously aware that your thumb is now hurt. ||| 如果一個錘打傷你嘅手指， 你手臂嘅導線，當然，我地稱為神經 將信息傳入脊髓裡面嘅連接盒 脊髓入面嘅新嘅線路、新嘅神經， 將信息上傳到大腦 你意識到你嘅手指受咗傷。 
 But the situation, of course, in the human body is far more complicated than that. ||| 不過在哩種情況下，當然，在人體內 要比哩個複雜好多。 
 Instead of it being the case that that junction box in the spinal cord is just simple where one nerve connects with the next nerve by releasing these little brown packets of chemical information called neurotransmitters in a linear one-on-one fashion, in fact, what happens is the neurotransmitters spill out in three dimensions — laterally, vertically, up and down in the spinal cord — and they start interacting with other adjacent cells. ||| 並唔係甘純粹 連接盒在脊髓入邊 神經之間嘅聯繫非常簡單 通過釋放哩D棕色包裹 內涵化學信息，我地叫佢做神經遞質 線性一一傳導信息， 事實上， 神經遞質嘅釋放在三維空間裡進行 脊髓入面：橫向，縱向，垂直 佢地開始與相連嘅細胞 相互作用 
 These cells, called glial cells, were once thought to be unimportant structural elements of the spinal cord that did nothing more than hold all the important things together, like the nerves. ||| 哩D細胞叫做膠質細胞， 之前被認為係 脊髓中最唔重要嘅結構元素 除咗幫助所有重要嘅好似神經細胞甘嘅物質 聚合在一齊之外，無其他用途。 
 But it turns out the glial cells have a vital role in the modulation, amplification and, in the case of pain, the distortion of sensory experiences. ||| 不過其實 膠質細胞扮演著一個重要角色 在調製，放大 同埋痛楚、扭曲 嘅感覺體驗入邊， 
 These glial cells become activated. ||| 哩D膠質細胞被激活 
 Their DNA starts to synthesize new proteins, which spill out and interact with adjacent nerves, and they start releasing their neurotransmitters, and those neurotransmitters spill out and activate adjacent glial cells, and so on and so forth, until what we have is a positive feedback loop. ||| 佢地嘅DNA開始合成 新蛋白跟住釋放出来。 同相連嘅神經相互作用， 佢地開始釋放神經遞質 果D神經遞質釋放出去 激活相連嘅膠質細胞，一直持續向前， 直到找到 一個確定嘅反饋迴路。 
 It's almost as if somebody came into your home and rewired your walls so that the next time you turned on the light switch, the toilet flushed three doors down, or your dishwasher went on, or your computer monitor turned off. ||| 就好似有人来到你屋企 重新在牆上拉線， 跟住下一次你開燈哥陣， 馬桶開始自動沖洗， 或者係你嘅洗碗機開咗， 或者係你嘅電腦屏幕開咗。 
 That's crazy, but that's, in fact, what happens with chronic pain. ||| 太瘋狂了， 但實際上就係咁 —— 慢性痛楚嘅情况。 
 And that's why pain becomes its own disease. ||| 也就係由痛楚變成疾病嘅原因。 
 The nervous system has plasticity. ||| 神經系統有可塑性， 
 It changes, and it morphs in response to stimuli. ||| 佢會改變，會變換 作為刺激嘅回應。 
 Well, what do we do about that? ||| 好，咁我地打算點做呢？ 
 What can we do in a case like Chandler's? ||| Chandler嘅病例我地可以點做？ 
 We treat these patients in a rather crude fashion at this point in time. ||| 目前我地對於哩D患者嘅治療方法 仲停留在非常粗糙嘅階段。 
 We treat them with symptom-modifying drugs — painkillers — which are, frankly, not very effective for this kind of pain. ||| 我地用可以改變症狀嘅藥物來治療佢地 止痛药 講真，對於哩類痛楚來講 唔係特別有效。 
 We take nerves that are noisy and active that should be quiet, and we put them to sleep with local anesthetics. ||| 對於本來安靜但係現在 亢奮過度嘅神經， 我地用局部麻醉方式令到佢地休眠。 
 And most importantly, what we do is we use a rigorous, and often uncomfortable, process of physical therapy and occupational therapy to retrain the nerves in the nervous system to respond normally to the activities and sensory experiences that are part of everyday life. ||| 最重要嘅係，我地所做嘅 係用一個嚴格嘅進程，通常並唔咁係舒服嘅 物理治療同職業療法 喺神經系統入面重新訓練神經 使到能正常應答 尤其係果D日常生活嘅所有 正常活動同感覺體驗。 
 And we support all of that with an intensive psychotherapy program to address the despondency, despair and depression that always accompanies severe, chronic pain. ||| 我地全力支持 用密集嘅心裡療法計劃 打擊嚴重慢性痛楚所引起嘅 失望、绝望、 憂慮症狀。 
 It's successful, as you can see from this video of Chandler, who, two months after we first met her, is now doings a back flip. ||| Chandler嘅病例係成功嘅， 你地睇到嘅視頻来自Chandler， 兩個月後嘅现在， 正在進行後翻身跳轉。 
 And I had lunch with her yesterday because she's a college student studying dance at Long Beach here, and she's doing absolutely fantastic. ||| 我我昨天同佢一齊吃午餐， 因為佢喺在長灘市嘅大學學習舞蹈。 佢表演得太好了。 
 But the future is actually even brighter. ||| 未來會更加精彩。 
 The future holds the promise that new drugs will be developed that are not symptom-modifying drugs that simply mask the problem, as we have now, but that will be disease-modifying drugs that will actually go right to the root of the problem and attack those glial cells, or those pernicious proteins that the glial cells elaborate, that spill over and cause this central nervous system wind-up, or plasticity, that so is capable of distorting and amplifying the sensory experience that we call pain. ||| 未來將承諾 新藥將會發展 成唔係症狀控制嘅藥物 我地現在哩D藥物， 太輕易地掩飾痛楚。 但係改變症狀嘅藥物 將會真正瞄準問題嘅本源 攻擊果D會擴張神經膠質細胞 產生有害蛋白 有害嘅蛋白， 佢地嘅釋放會終結可塑嘅 樞神經系統， 咁樣就可以扭曲同放大 感覺體驗嘅能力 我地稱之為痛楚。 
 "So I have hope that in the future, the prophetic words of George Carlin will be realized, who said, ""My philosophy: No pain, no pain."" Thank you very much." ||| 所以我希望 在未来， George Carlin嘅预言可以被咁樣理解， 佢話：我嘅哲學： “唔痛，唔痛” 多谢大家 
 (Applause) ||| （鼓掌） 
 Let's start with leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, ALL, the most common cancer of children. ||| 我哋就由白血病開始講 急性淋巴細胞性白血病，俗稱 ALL 係細路仔最常見嘅癌症 
 When I was a student, the mortality rate was about 95 percent. ||| 當我仲係學生嘅時候 死亡率係大概 95% 
 Today, some 25, 30 years later, we're talking about a mortality rate that's reduced by 85 percent. ||| 25、30 年之後嘅今日，我哋講梗嘅係 呢種病嘅死亡率下降咗 85% 
 Heart disease used to be the biggest killer, particularly for men in their 40s. ||| 以前，尤其是對四字頭的男性嚟講 心臟病係最犀利嘅殺手 
 Now this is, of course, not a disease, per se. ||| 咁當然啦，自殺本身唔係一種病 
 There are 38,000 suicides each year in the United States. ||| 喺美國，每一年都有 38,000 宗自殺案件 
 That means one about every 15 minutes. ||| 亦即係話每 15 分鐘就有一單 
 But it's not just the mortality from these disorders. ||| 但係，呢啲病唔單止增加死亡風險 
 You're probably thinking that doesn't make any sense. ||| 你可能覺得頭先講嘅嘢無理 
 I mean, cancer seems far more serious. ||| 我意思係話，癌症點睇 都比精神病嚴重得多 
 Why are they number one here? ||| 點解佢哋喺個名單度係排第一？ 
 Well, there are probably three reasons. ||| 咁，其實係有三個原因嘅 
 Now, I started by telling you that there were some good-news stories. ||| 咁，我開頭同你哋講咗會有好消息 
 Actually, I work for you. You pay my salary. ||| 亦即係為你哋做嘢，係你哋俾我人工 
 "Now, for some of you, you're going to say, ""Oh my goodness, here we go again." ||| 嗱，而家你哋有啲人會諗： 「噢，天啊，又嚟啦。 
 You'll hear more about this in a few minutes. ||| 我之後會再講多啲呢樣嘢 
 But look at this closely and you can see that actually they've crossed a different threshold. ||| 但係，睇真啲 
 But most important, go back to where we started. ||| 但係最重要嘅 我哋返返去我哋一開始嗰度 
 We wait until the behavior becomes manifest. ||| 我哋只能夠等到行為徵狀 出咗嚟先做到嘢 
 That's not early detection. That's not early intervention. ||| 所以呢樣唔係提早偵測或者介入 
 (Applause) ||| （掌聲） 
 It's funny the things you forget. ||| 唔記得嘅事係幾有趣 
 (Laughter) (Applause) Because that's how you die. (Laughter) ||| （笑聲） （掌聲） 因為我哋都係咁死 （笑聲） 
 And I remember, that was a game I used to play with myself to entertain myself whenever I was bored or frustrated. (Laughter) ||| 仲記得我悶同煩惱嗰陣 我都會咁樣同自己玩，娛樂自己 （笑聲） 
 I don't know about that, but I just know that I get too many marketing emails. ||| 我唔知道呀 但我剩係知我收到好多推廣電郵 
 "So what I did was I scrolled down to the bottom of the email, and I pressed, ""Unsubscribe."" And I thought that'd be the end of it." ||| 於是我拉落去電郵最底 㩒取消訂閱 我以為就咁可以告一段落 
 So I tried it again. Right? ||| 所以我再試多次 
 And here's the problem: The internet gave us access to everything; but it also gave everything access to us. ||| 呢度有一個問題 我哋因為互聯網而知道曬所有嘅嘢 同時我哋都暴露無遺 
 "They got back to me; a guy called Dan said, "Hi James. I've asked a colleague to help me with your query."" ||| 然後有個叫 Dan 嘅男人回覆我︰ 「你好 James，我已經 叫我同事回答你嘅問題。」 
 "And I said, ""What's the plan, Dan?" ||| 我話︰「Dan 你有咩計劃？ 
 "I'm thinking fireworks, bouncy castle ..."" (Laughter) "I'm not sure what you mean." (Laughter)" ||| 我諗緊煙花、充氣城堡…」 （笑聲） 「我唔係好明你意思。」 （笑聲） 
 "I said, ""I'm just tremendously excited about the opening!"" (Laughter) "Do you want to book the bouncy castle or shall I?"" ||| 我話︰「我只係對開幕超級期待！」 （笑聲） 「你想唔想訂充氣城堡， 或者我幫你訂？」 
 "He said, ""I think you have misunderstood."" (Laughter) "A new store is opening, but there is no celebration planned."" ||| 佢話︰「我諗有啲誤會。」 （笑聲） 「新店開幕，不過冇慶祝計劃。」 
 "I said, ""But what was all the 'Three weeks until,' 'Two weeks until' emails?" ||| 我話︰「但係啲倒數嘅電郵 令我愈來愈興奮！」 
 "I said, ""Not to worry." ||| 我話︰「唔緊要， 
 Let's do something anyway! ||| 等我哋做啲嘢。 
 "He said, ""Mr. Veitch, I'm not responsible for anything you have ordered."" I said, ""Let's not get into who did what." ||| 佢話︰「Veitch 先生， 我唔係負責你訂購咗嘅嘢。」 我話︰「咁我哋唔傾邊個負責乜嘢。」 
 That's outrageous. ||| 咁好奇怪 
 "I said, ""Dan?"" (Laughter) And I got — and I was just like, this is ... — and I, I ...." ||| 我話︰「Dan？」 （笑聲） 之後我收到… 
 "I said, ""But Dan, they must have wondered why there was no bouncy castle."" And then we were back to this." ||| 我話︰「但係 Dan， 之後我哋又去返檔案編號 
 It was like we were dancing. ||| 我哋好似跳舞咁有一段美好嘅關係 
 So what I did is I have a little email auto-replier program. ||| 所以我整咗個小小嘅 電郵自動回覆程式 
 "So I set it up, and it says, "Thanks for your email - your Case Number is ..."" ||| 我設定內容係︰ 「多謝你嘅電郵，你嘅檔案編號係…」 
 I checked back on it the other day, and it appears there have been a number of emails going back and forth. ||| 有一日我睇返 我至發覺我同佢之間 一直都有好多電郵來來回回 
 We're on 21,439. ||| 我哋目前嘅編號係 21439 
 (Laughter) Thank you. ||| （笑聲） 多謝 
 (Applause) ||| （掌聲） 
 And it managed to get through my spam filter. ||| 佢過到個垃圾郵件過濾 
 I'm not quite sure how, but it turned up in my inbox, and it was from a guy called Solomon Odonkoh. ||| 我唔係好知點解 寄件人係叫 Solomon Odonkoh 
 I'm putting together a visual for you to take into the board meeting. ||| 我陣間過張圖表畀你， 方便你喺董事會上講清楚。 
 Also you can cut up carrots, and you can dip them. ||| 你仲可以切啲紅蘿蔔 點落鷹嘴豆泥添！

 I've gone too far. So I had to backpedal a little. ||| 於是我收念返少少 
 "I said, ""Solomon, Is the deal still on?" ||| 我話︰「Solomon， 我哋交易仲繼續㗎呵？ 
 It's really difficult, and I highly recommend we do it. ||| 雖然覆電郵係好困難 但我好建議大家一齊做 
 I don't think what I'm doing is mean. ||| 我唔覺得自己咁做好衰 
 There are a lot of people who do mean things to scammers. ||| 大把人對詐騙集團做衰嘢

 I know so many. ||| 我識好多個 Winnie Mandela 㗎嘛 
 She sent me this, which is hysterical. ||| 佢仲畀咗呢樣嘢我，勁搞笑 
 And this looks fairly legitimate, this is a letter of authorization. ||| 咁望落去好合情合理呀 呢封係一封授權信 
 "I love stories. I want to read."" Little did I know that I would be part of a technological revolution that would make that dream come true." ||| 我鍾意故仔，我想讀佢哋。」 我真係冇諗到 我會係一場技術革命嘅一分子 令到細個想摸書嘅願望成真 
 I was born premature by about 10 weeks, which resulted in my blindness, some 64 years ago. ||| 阿媽早產我十個禮拜 導致我 64 年前失明 
 The condition is known as retrolental fibroplasia, and it's now very rare in the developed world. ||| 呢種情況稱為晶狀體後纖維增生症 已經喺發達國家好少見 
 But let me tell you a bit about it today. ||| 但係，等我我講少少我嘅故事 
 When I was five, I went to school and I learned braille. ||| 五歲嗰時我返學係學盲人凸字 
 It's an ingenious system of six dots that are punched into paper, and I can feel them with my fingers. ||| 盲人凸字係一個 剩係得六個點嘅巧妙系統 嗰啲點鑿入紙裏邊 透過手指，我可以感覺到佢哋 
 In fact, I think they're putting up my grade six report. ||| 事實上，我覺得學校啲人 喺度展示梗我六年班嘅報告 
 I don't know where Julian Morrow got that from. ||| 我唔知 Julian Morrow 佢喺邊度攞返嚟 
 (Laughter) I was pretty good in reading, but religion and musical appreciation needed more work. (Laughter) ||| （笑聲） 我閱讀科好叻 但宗教同音樂科要多啲努力 （笑聲） 
 When you leave the opera house, you'll find there's braille signage in the lifts. ||| 當你離開劇院 你會發現，電梯裡邊有盲人凸字 
 Look for it. Have you noticed it? ||| 搵下！搵唔搵到？ 
 I do. I look for it all the time. ||| 我成日都搵嗰喎！ 
 I gave them a tape recorder, and they read into it. ||| 我將錄音機交畀佢哋，佢哋錄低聲音 
 "As one of them said to me, "Ron, we ain't going anywhere at the moment."" ||| 有一個人同我講︰ 「Ron，我哋宜家無地方去， 我哋可以幫你。」 
 One of the reasons I agreed to give this talk today was that I was hoping that Lois would be here so I could introduce you to her and publicly thank her. ||| 其中一個我今日應承講上嚟講嘅原因 係我希望 Lois Doery 佢今日能夠喺度 令我可以介紹佢畀你哋，並公開多謝佢 
 But sadly, her health hasn't permitted her to come today. ||| 可惜今日，佢身體抱恙，未能夠嚟到 
 But I thank you here, Lois, from this platform. ||| 但我想喺呢度多謝你 Lois Doery 
 How very wrong I was. ||| 我諗得好錯 
 See it up there? ||| 見到未？ 
 And you see it has no, what do you call it, no screen. ||| 你發現佢冇屏幕 
 (Laughter) It's a blind computer. (Laughter) ||| （笑聲） 佢係一台盲人電腦 （笑聲） 
 It's a Keynote Gold 84k, and the 84k stands for it had 84 kilobytes of memory. (Laughter) ||| 佢叫做 Keynote Gold 84k 84k 代表佢有 84KB 記憶體 （笑聲） 
 Don't laugh, it cost me 4,000 dollars at the time. (Laughter) I think there's more memory in my watch. ||| 唔好笑，當時佢使咗我四千美金 我諗我手錶嘅記憶體都多過佢 
 It was invented by Russell Smith, a passionate inventor in New Zealand who was trying to help blind people. ||| 佢係由一個充滿熱情嘅發明家  Russell Smith 發明 居住喺新西蘭，致力幫助盲人 
 Sadly, he died in a light plane crash in 2005, but his memory lives on in my heart. ||| 不幸地，2005 年 但佢永遠喺我心裡面 
 It meant, for the first time, I could read back what I had typed into it. ||| 講返轉頭，即係話第一次 我可以將我打出嚟嘅嘢讀出嚟 
 It had a speech synthesizer. ||| 佢有一個語音合成器 
 This now allowed me to read back what I'd written and to enter the computer world, even with its 84k of memory. ||| 咁嘅電腦令我知道自己打咗乜嘢 同埋，就算係得 84k 記憶體 我都一樣可以走進電腦世界 
 In 1974, the great Ray Kurzweil, the American inventor, worked on building a machine that would scan books and read them out in synthetic speech. ||| 1974 年，美國發明家 Ray Kurzweil 開發一台可以掃描書本嘅機器 透過語音合成讀出嚟 
 And his machine, which was as big as a washing machine, was launched on the 13th of January, 1976. ||| 佢呢部同洗衣機一樣大嘅機 喺 1976 年 1 月 13 日推出 
 I didn't have to be nice to people! ||| 我就唔需要求人啦！ 
 (Laughter) I no longer would be censored. ||| （笑聲） 唔好再有人審査我 
 There are many people who have helped me in my life, and many that I haven't met. ||| 我生命裏邊有好多幫過我嘅人 仲有好多我從未見過嘅人 
 One is another American inventor Ted Henter. ||| 其中一位係美國發明家 Ted Henter 
 Ted was a motorcycle racer, but in 1978 he had a car accident and lost his sight, which is devastating if you're trying to ride motorbikes. ||| 佢以前係電單車車手 1978 年因為車禍失明 對於渣電單車嘅人嚟講非常之慘 
 He then turned to being a waterskier and was a champion disabled waterskier. ||| 之後佢轉咗去玩滑水 仲成為殘疾人滑水比賽冠軍 
 I slowed it down for you. ||| 其實係我較慢咗啫 
 Isn't that a great book? ||| 唔係一本好書嗎？ 
 I still love being close to someone reading to me. ||| 我仲鍾意坐近讀俾我聽嘅人 
 But I wouldn't give up the technology, because it's allowed me to lead a great life. ||| 但我唔會因此唔用文字閱讀器 事關閱讀器帶俾我精彩生活 
 There are other barriers brought about by our laws. ||| 我哋嘅法律也帶嚟咗障礙 
 But those books can't travel across borders. ||| 但呢啲書唔能夠喺其他國家使用 
 For example, in Spain, there are a 100,000 accessible books in Spanish. ||| 例如西班牙文嘅書籍 喺西班牙有十萬 
 In Argentina, there are 50,000. ||| 喺阿根廷有五萬 
 And remember I was telling you about Harry Potter. ||| 記得我頭先講過哈利波特 
 I've indeed been a very fortunate human being. ||| 我自覺係一個幸福嘅人 
 I'd like to thank my researcher Hannah Martin, who is my slide clicker, who clicks the slides, and my wife, Professor Mary Crock, who's the light of my life, is coming on to collect me. ||| 我想多謝我嘅研究員 Hannah Martin 佢一路喺度幫我襟下一張投影片 我要多謝老婆 Mary Crock 佢會嚟接我 
 I want to thank her too. ||| 我要感謝我太太 
 I think I have to say goodbye now. ||| 我諗我要講再見喇 
 Bless you. Thank you very much. ||| 祝大家平安。多謝曬 
 However, although it's very, very sad this news, it's also thanks to their personal stories that we have raised awareness of how lethal this disease can be. ||| 雖然係一件好唔好嘅事 但係都要多謝人哋報導佢哋嘅故仔 畀我哋注意到胰腺癌可以有幾致命 
 It's become the third cause of cancer deaths, and only eight percent of the patients will survive beyond five years. ||| 胰臟癌排喺癌症死因嘅第三位 只有百分之八嘅病人有超過五年夀命 
 So it doesn't really come as a surprise that being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer means facing an almost certain death sentence. ||| 所以當病人畀醫生診斷爲胰腺癌之後 病人一啲都唔感到意外 因為差唔多畀人判咗死刑 
 It's depicted in orange on the screen. ||| 它喺屏幕上嘅橙色位置 
 But you can barely see it until I remove all the other organs in front. ||| 但係你幾乎睇唔到佢 除非我將前面其他器官拎走 
 It's also surrounded by many other vital organs, like the liver, the stomach, the bile duct. ||| 但佢又畀好多重要嘅器官包圍住 例如肝、胃、膽管 
 The hard-to-reach location also prevents the doctor from surgically removing it, as is routinely done for breast cancer, for example. ||| 佢嘅位置難以接近 亦令醫生好難用手術移除佢 醫生成日為其他 好似乳癌咁嘅腫瘤做手術 
 This brings us to the second piece of bad news. ||| 跟住講第二個壞消息 
 Pancreatic cancer tumors have very few blood vessels. ||| 胰腺癌腫瘤有好少血管 
 Why should we care about the blood vessel of a tumor? ||| 點解我哋要關心一個腫瘤嘅血管？ 
 Let's think for a second how chemotherapy works. ||| 等我哋嚟諗下化療係點樣做嘢嘅 
 The drug is injected in the vein and it navigates throughout the body until it reaches the tumor site. ||| 藥物被注射入靜脈之後 藥物流過我哋嘅身體直至去到腫瘤嗰度 
 It's like driving on a highway, trying to reach a destination. ||| 好似喺高速公路開車，努力駛去目的地 
 But what if your destination doesn't have an exit on the highway? ||| 但係如果公路冇出口去你嘅目的地呢？ 
 You will never get there. ||| 你永遠都去唔到 
 And that's exactly the same problem for chemotherapy and pancreatic cancer. ||| 醫生處理化療同胰腺癌 就正正面對相同嘅問題 
 The drugs navigate throughout all of your body. ||| 藥物流過你嘅身體 
 They will reach healthy organs, resulting in high toxic effect for the patients overall, but very little will go to the tumor. ||| 佢哋會到達一啲健康嘅器官 令病人整體上出現高度中毒反應 但係藥物好少會去到腫瘤嗰度 
 Therefore, the efficacy is very limited. ||| 所以療效好有限 
 To me, it seems very counterintuitive to have a whole-body treatment to target a specific organ. ||| 我覺得為咗一個器官而要全身治療 好似違反常理咁 
 So after two pieces of bad news, I'm going to give you good news, hopefully. ||| 聽咗兩個壞消息之後 我會話你知好消息 
 With a collaborator at MIT and the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, we have revolutionized the way we treat cancer by making localized drug delivery a reality. ||| 我哋同麻省理工大學 同埋波士頓嘅麻省總醫院合作 徹底改變治療癌症嘅方法 實現藥物局部輸送 
 We are basically parachuting you on top of your destination, avoiding your having to drive all around the highway. ||| 我哋基本上將你空降到你要嘅目的地 而唔使你行成條高速公路 
 We have embedded the drug into devices that look like this one. ||| 我哋將藥物注入咗類似呢啲裝置入面 
 The devices are also biodegradable. ||| 呢啲裝置仲係生物分解 
 That means that once in the body, they start dissolving, delivering the drug only locally, slowly and more effectively than what is done with the current whole-body treatment. ||| 即是佢哋一旦擺喺身體入面 佢哋就會開始被分解 比起現時全身治療 藥物更加局部、慢慢、有效咁輸送 
 So we took a drug that is already known and by just delivering it locally where it's needed the most, we allow a response that is 12 times more powerful, reducing the systemic toxic effect. ||| 所以我哋用一隻已知嘅藥物 只係將佢放係最需要佢嘅地方 我哋有咗十二倍嘅療效 仲減少身體中毒反應 
 We are working relentlessly to bring this technology to the next level. ||| 我哋好努力咁將呢項技術 帶入下一階段 
 We are finalizing the pre-clinical testing and the animal model required prior to asking the FDA for approval for clinical trials. ||| 我哋就嚟做完臨牀前試驗同動物試驗 做咗呢兩個先可以向美國藥物管理局 申請做臨牀試驗 
 Currently, the majority of patients will die from pancreatic cancer. ||| 宜家大多數胰腺癌病人都冇得醫 
 Thank you very much. ||| 多謝大家 
 (Applause) ||| （掌聲） 
 I was a lonely kid. ||| 細個時我好孤單 
 "(Laughter) I was like, ""Are they reading my mind?" ||| （笑聲） 我就諗︰「唔通佢哋解讀緊我嘅思想？ 
 and start suppressing their church giggles. ||| 個個人都喺度揞住嘴偷笑 
 This was the big leagues — this was costuming mecca. ||| 呢場動漫展好比 服裝界嘅盛事、服裝界嘅麥加 
 People fly in from all over the world to show their amazing creations on the floor in San Diego. ||| 啲人從世界各地飛過去 展示佢哋嘅驚世嘅作品 
 They're super clever and genius. ||| 佢哋係犀利嘅天才 
 And it's so beautiful to watch. ||| 而呢一幕真係好靚，我會將佢記低 
 And at the end of the photo process, I'd make it appear for them. ||| 等佢哋影完相之後，我會送佢哋金幣 
 And I'm feeling and I'm walking the floor and it's fantastic. ||| 我好享受，之後我繼續喺動漫展度行 
 And about 15 minutes in something happens. ||| 大概喺 15 分鐘之後，有件事發生咗 
 And I keep on going, I take some more pictures. ||| 於是我繼續行，我又影咗更多嘅相 
 Understand, I can't see anything inside this costume. ||| 你要知道，著住套衫嗰時 
 And then it hits me: it's bad luck to take gold from No-Face. ||| 呢一幕令我突然醒悟： 摞到無面男嘅金幣係不祥之兆 
 This isn't a performer-audience relationship; this is cosplay. ||| 呢個唔係講緊演員同觀眾嘅關係 
 And we're making it our own. ||| 再將佢變成我哋自己嘅故事 
 Pull the knot. ||| 拉個結。 
 What did it mean that he was dead? ||| 祖父「死」到底係乜意思？ 
 Where had he gone? ||| 佢去咗邊度？ 
 But then the really shocking question occurred to me: If he could die, could it happen to me too? ||| 但同時我又諗到一個非常可怕嘅問題 既然祖父會死，我係唔係都會死？ 
 Could that hole in reality open up and swallow me? ||| 嗰個窿會唔會都打開吞咗我架？ 
 Well, at some point, all children become aware of death. ||| 其實到某個歲數 所有細路仔都會察覺到死亡 
 It can happen in different ways, of course, and usually comes in stages. ||| 當然，佢哋發現嘅方式可能唔一樣 但通常都係有幾個階段嘅 
 Our idea of death develops as we grow older. ||| 我哋對死亡嘅認識隨著年齡增長 
 This is, if you like, our curse. ||| 或者，呢個就係對人類嘅詛咒 
 It's the price we pay for being so damn clever. ||| 亦係我哋聰明所付出嘅代價 
 And that's frightening. It's terrifying. ||| 呢樣嘢係好可怕、好恐佈 
 And so we look for a way out. ||| 所以我哋就搵方法擺脫佢 
 Now this didn't sound very plausible. ||| 但呢種講法好似唔太合理 
 I used to watch a children's news program at the time, and this was the era of space exploration. ||| 我嗰時收睇緊一個兒童嘅新聞節目 嗰陣係太空探索嘅年代 
 Periods. ||| 經期 
 Gross. ||| 核突 
 Why? ||| 點解？ 
 A phenomenon that is so significant that the survival and propagation of our species depends on it. ||| 呢個現象好緊要 因為關乎人類生存同繁殖後代 
 Yet we consider it a taboo. ||| 但是我哋覺得呢啲係禁忌 
 We feel awkward and shameful talking about it. ||| 講呢樣嗰時又尷尬又覺得羞恥 
 When I got my first periods, I was told to keep it a secret from others — even from my father and brother. ||| 當我嚟咗第一次經期時 有人叫我唔好話俾人聽 連兄弟同爸爸，都唔好講 
 Later when this chapter appeared in our textbooks, our biology teacher skipped the subject. ||| 無幾耐，當我嘅敎科書講到呢樣嘢 我嘅生物科老師竟然跳過呢個課題 
 (Laughter) You know what I learned from it? ||| （笑聲） 你知我從中學到乜嘢？ 
 I learned that it is really shameful to talk about it. ||| 就係學識講呢樣嘢係好羞恥 
 I learned to be ashamed of my body. ||| 對自己嘅身體感到難為情 
 I learned to stay unaware of periods in order to stay decent. ||| 學識點樣唔覺經期嚟咗 咁樣就可以好莊重 
 And in some parts of Rajasthan this number is as high as nine out of 10 girls being unaware of it. ||| 拉賈欺坦有啲地方 每十個女仔有多到九個都唔識 
 You'd be surprised to know that most of the girls that I have spoken to, who did not know about periods at the time of their first menstruation thought that they have got blood cancer and they're going to die soon. ||| 你哋會好出奇 我同好多女仔傾過 佢哋竟然唔知第一次經期就係月經 仲以為係患咗血癌 以為要死 
 If you do the math, 88 percent of girls and women use unhygienic ways to manage their periods. ||| 如果你計下數 就知有 88％ 婦女經期處理得唔衛生 
 I was one of them. ||| 我就係其中一個 
 I grew up in a small town called Garhwa, in Jharkhand, where even buying a sanitary napkin is considered shameful. ||| 我係加爾克漢德省加爾赫瓦小城長大 聽到啲人連去買衛生巾 我都覺得好瘀 
 After every use I would wash and reuse them. ||| 每次用完都會洗乾淨再用過 
 But to store them, I would hide and keep it in a dark, damp place so that nobody finds out that I'm menstruating. ||| 但係收拾嗰時 就要收埋係又黑又濕嘅地方 咁樣就無人知道我月經嚟咗 
 Due to repeated washing the rags would become coarse, and I would often get rashes and infections using them. ||| 由於重覆清洗，碎布已經粗糙 我用咗之後，成日出疹或者感染病 
 I wore these already for five years until I moved out of that town. ||| 我用咗足足五年 直到我搬離呢個城市 
 I was not allowed to touch or eat pickles. ||| 唔准掂同食醃菜 
 I was not allowed to sit on the sofa or some other family member's bed. ||| 唔准坐梳化或者屋企人嘅床上 
 I had to wash my bed sheet after every period, even if it was not stained. ||| 每次經期完咗要洗床單 就算床單無汚糟到 
 I was considered impure and forbidden from worshipping or touching any object of religious importance. ||| 他們認為我唔純潔 禁止我參拜或者掂一啲聖物 
 You'll find signposts outside temples denying the entry of menstruating girls and women. ||| 你會發現寺廟出面有牌路牌 禁止正在嚟緊經期嘅婦女進入 
 Ironically, most of the time it is the older woman who imposes such restrictions on younger girls in a family. ||| 真係諷刺 好多時上咗年紀嘅女人 將咁樣嘅限制對付屋企嘅細路女 
 After all, they have grown up accepting such restrictions as norms. ||| 雖然咁樣，佢哋大個咗之後 
 During my years of work in this field, I have even come across stories where girls have to eat and wash their dishes separately. ||| 我係呢個領域工作嗰時 曾經聽過有啲傳說 話嚟咗經期嘅女仔 要分開洗自己用過嘅碗碟 
 They're not allowed to take baths during periods, and in some households they are even secluded from other family members. ||| 又唔准冲涼 有啲家庭甚至將佢哋同屋企人隔離 
 About 85 percent of girls and women in India would follow one or more restrictive customs on their periods every month. ||| 大約有 85％ 印度婦女喺月經來潮時 要遵守一個或以上嘅風俗規限 
 In 2009, Tuhin and I were pursuing our postgraduation in design. ||| 2009年，我同佢攻讀設計學研究 
 We fell in love with each other and I was at ease discussing periods with him. ||| 我哋共墮愛河 我好輕鬆同佢討論月經的事情 
 Tuhin knew little about periods. ||| 佢知道少少 
 (Laughter) He was astonished to know that girls get painful cramps and we bleed every month. (Laughter) ||| （笑聲） 佢對於我哋每月都出血 同腹部絞痛，感到驚訝 （笑聲） 
 Yeah. ||| 係囉 
 In order to help me with my cramps, he would go on the Internet and learn more about menstruation. ||| 佢為咗幫我解決腹絞痛嘅問題 佢上網學習更多月經知識 
 When he shared his findings with me, I realized how little I knew about menstruation myself. ||| 當佢俾我睇佢搵到嘅資料時 我先至發覺自己對月經嘅認識好皮毛 
 And many of my beliefs actually turned out to be myths. ||| 好多我哋嘅傳統睇法其實都係鬼話 
 That's when we wondered: if we, being so well educated, were so ill-informed about menstruation, there would be millions of girls out there who would be ill-informed, too. ||| 我哋於是諗： 如果我哋接受咗高等敎育 對月經都有誤解 咁樣嗰啲數以百萬嘅女仔都會一樣 
 While it is generally believed that menstrual unawareness and misconception is a rural phenomenon, during my research, I found that it is as much an urban phenomenon as well. ||| 通常啲人相信 鄉村嘅地方至會有呢啲現象 但我硏究期間 發現原來市區都係一樣 
 And it exists with the educated urban class, also. ||| 而且出現喺受過教育嘅階層 
 While talking to many parents and teachers, I found that many of them actually wanted to educate girls about periods before they have started getting their menstrual cycle. ||| 我同過好多家長、老師傾過 發現佢地多數都想喺女仔月經開始前 敎佢哋月經嘅知識 
 And — but they lacked the proper means themselves. ||| 唔⋯ 但係家長同敎師都冇啱嘅方法 
 And since it is a taboo, they feel inhibition and shameful in talking about it. ||| 因為月經係社會禁忌 佢哋講呢樣嘢嘅時候 覺得拘謹同好羞恥 
 And since it is a taboo, teachers still skip the subject altogether. ||| 由於呢啲係禁忌 教師仍然跳過呢個課題 
 So school does not teach girls about periods, parents don't talk about it. ||| 於是學校唔講 父母唔講 
 Where do the girls go? ||| 咁啲女仔點算？ 
 Two decades ago and now — nothing has changed. ||| 由廿年前至到宜家 無嘢改過 
 During my research, I was collecting a lot of stories. ||| 我做硏究期間 收集好多關於 女仔月經來潮經歷嘅故仔 
 That's what we wanted. ||| 呢個就係我哋嘅目的 
 We wanted something that would make the girls curious and drive them to learn about it. ||| 我哋想有啲嘢令到女仔好奇 然後令佢哋走去了解月經 
 We wanted to use these stories to teach girls about periods. ||| 我哋想用呢啲故事去敎佢哋 
 So we decided to create a comic book, where the cartoon characters would enact these stories and educate girls about menstruation in a fun and engaging way. ||| 於是決定創作一本漫畫書 書中嘅卡通人物會扮演呢啲故事 用有趣同搞笑的方法敎識佢哋 
 To represent girls in their different phases of puberty, we have three characters. ||| 我哋有三個人物 代表女仔青春期嘅唔同階段 
 Pinki, who has not gotten her period yet, Jiya who gets her period during the narrative of the book and Mira who has already been getting her period. ||| Pinki 還未有經期嚟 Jiya 剛剛經期嚟到 Mira 已經嚟過經期 
 There is a fourth character, Priya Didi. ||| 第四個人物係 Priya Didi 
 Through her, girls come to know about the various aspects of growing up and menstrual hygiene management. ||| 因為佢，啲女仔知道成長嘅各種嘢 同點樣保持經期衛生 
 While making the book, we took great care that none of the illustrations were objectionable in any way and that it is culturally sensitive. ||| 我哋好有心機創作呢本書 漫畫插圖唔會惹人反感 但文化題材有啲敏感 
 During our prototype testing, we found that the girls loved the book. ||| 我哋做樣本測試時 
 They were keen on reading it and knowing more and more about periods on their own. ||| 佢哋好想睇呢本書 等自己知道多啲經期嘅知識 
 Parents and teachers were comfortable in talking about periods to young girls using the book, and sometimes even boys were interested in reading it. ||| 家長同老師可以好輕鬆咁利用呢本書 同啲細路女討論經期 有時連男仔都有興趣睇下呢本書 
 (Laughter) (Applause) The comic book helped in creating an environment where menstruation ceased to be a taboo. ||| （笑聲） （掌聲） 呢本漫畫書營做咗一個環境 令月經唔再係禁忌 
 Many of the volunteers took this prototype themselves to educate girls and take menstrual awareness workshops in five different states in India. ||| 好多義工帶呢本樣本書 去印度五個地方敎啲女仔 仲舉行埋認識經期嘅工作坊 
 And one of the volunteers took this prototype to educate young monks and took it to this monastery in Ladakh. ||| 有一個義工帶咗本書去教年輕僧人 仲帶本書到去 Ladakh 嘅修道院 
 "We made the final version of the book, called ""Menstrupedia Comic"" and launched in September last year." ||| 我哋訂咗書最後嘅版本 而且喺舊年九月發行 
 And so far, more than 4,000 girls have been educated by using the book in India and — (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) ||| 到目前為止 已經有多過四千個印度 同其他十個國家嘅女仔讀過本書 （掌聲） 多謝 （掌聲） 
 And 10 different countries. ||| 好多女仔讀過本書 
 We are constantly translating the book into different languages and collaborating with local organizations to make this book available in different countries. ||| 我哋一直將本書翻譯成唔同語言 仲同本地機構合作 等呢本書係唔同國家都見到 
 15 schools in different parts of India have made this book a part of their school curriculum to teach girls about menstruation. ||| 15 間嚟自印度唔同地方嘅學校 已經將呢本書加入學校嘅課程 敎女仔月經嘅知識 
 I dream of a future where menstruation is not a curse, not a disease, but a welcoming change in a girl's life. ||| 我夢想將來月經唔會係一種咀咒 亦唔係一種病 而係女仔歡迎嘅人生改變 
 And I would — (Applause) And I would like to end this with a small request to all the parents here. ||| 我仲會.... （掌聲） 結束今日嘅演講之前 我想向在座嘅所有父母有一個小要求 
 Dear parents, if you would be ashamed of periods, your daughters would be, too. ||| 各位爸爸媽媽 如果你對經期覺得羞恥 咁你哋個女都會一樣 
 So please be period positive. ||| 請你哋對經期抱著積極的態度 
 (Laughter) Thank you. ||| （笑聲） 多謝 
 (Applause) ||| （掌聲） 
 Hi everyone. ||| 哈嘍，大家好。 
 I'm an artist and a dad — second time around. ||| 我系一名藝術家，亦系一位爹地。第二次當爹地了。 
 Thank you. ||| 多謝。 
 And I want to share with you my latest art project. ||| 我想同大家分享我最新嘅藝術項目。 
 It's a children's book for the iPad. ||| 系為iPad設計嘅一款小兒書。 
 It's a little quirky and silly. ||| 有少少搞怪，有少少傻。 
 "It's called ""Pop-It,"" And it's about the things little kids do with their parents." ||| 佢叫做“泡泡書” 系關於細路仔同佢地嘅父母一齊做嘅嘢。 
 (Music) So this is about potty training — as most of you, I hope, know. ||| （音樂） 所以，呢個就系關於上廁所嘅“訓練”啦—— 我希望，大家都知啦。 
 You can tickle the rug. ||| 你可以玩小地毯。 
 You can make the baby poop. ||| 你可以幫BB仔便便。 
 You can do all those fun things. ||| 你可以做所有呢地有趣嘅事。 
 You can burst bubbles. ||| 你可以嘟爆滴泡泡。 
 You can draw, as everyone should. ||| 你可以畫畫，大家都可以。 
 But you know, I have a problem with children's books: I think they're full of propaganda. ||| 不過，你知啦，我對小兒書有個想法： 我覺得入邊太多宣傳啦。 
 At least an Indian trying to get one of these American books in Park Slope, forget it. ||| 最起碼，一個印度人去買上流社會嘅美國書籍，算了吧。 
 It's not the way I was brought up. ||| 呢種唔系我長大嘅方式。 
 "So I said, ""I'm going to counter this with my own propaganda."" If you notice carefully, it's a homosexual couple bringing up a child." ||| 所以，我就講：“我要用我自己嘅宣傳去對抗。” 如果你細心嘅睇下， 呢果系一對男同性夫妻同一個細路仔。 
 You don't like it? ||| 你唔中意？ 
 Shake it, and you have a lesbian couple. ||| 搖下，依家變成佐女同性夫妻啦。 
 (Laughter) Shake it, and you have a heterosexual couple. ||| （笑……） 搖下，依家又變成異性夫妻啦。 
 You know, I don't even believe in the concept of an ideal family. ||| 你知嘅，我唔相信有么嘢系叫做理想家庭嘅。 
 I have to tell you about my childhood. ||| 我想話卑你知，我嘅童年。 
 I went to this very proper Christian school taught by nuns, fathers, brothers, sisters. ||| 我去佐一個很好嘅基督教學校。 老師系修女，神父，兄弟，姐妹。 
 Basically, I was brought up to be a good Samaritan, and I am. ||| 基本上，佢地希望我成為一個很善良的人。 事實上都系咁。 
 And I'd go at the end of the day to a traditional Hindu house, which was probably the only Hindu house in a predominantly Islamic neighborhood. ||| 每日晚上，我去到一個傳統的印度教會。 系一個伊斯蘭教興盛的街區里， 果間或者就系唯一一間印度度教會。 
 Basically, I celebrated every religious function. ||| 基本上，我會慶祝所有嘅宗教慶典。 
 In fact, when there was a wedding in our neighborhood, all of us would paint our houses for the wedding. ||| 事實上，如果隔壁有人結婚， 我都所有人都會為果個婚禮粉刷我地間屋。 
 I remember we cried profusely when the little goats we played with in the summer became biriani. ||| 當夏日同我地一齊玩嘅果地羊仔， 變成佐蓋澆飯， 我記得我地都哭地好慘。 
 (Laughter) We all had to fast during Ramadan. ||| （笑……） 齋月果陣時，我地都要食齋。 
 It was a very beautiful time. ||| 果段時間很美好。 
 But I must say, I'll never forget, when I was 13 years old, this happened. ||| 但系，我要講， 我唔會旺季，我13歲果時，發生嘅事。 
 Babri Masjid — one of the most beautiful mosques in India, built by King Babur, I think, in the 16th century — was demolished by Hindu activists. ||| 巴布里清真寺—— 印度最靚嘅一間清真寺之一， 我想，系16世紀由巴布爾國王建造嘅， 佢被印度教活躍分子摧毀佐。 
 This caused major riots in my city. ||| 呢件事系我嘅城市裡造成佐好大嘅動亂。 
 And for the first time, I was affected by this communal unrest. ||| 第一次， 我被呢種族群暴亂， 所影響。 
 "My little five-year-old kid neighbor comes running in, and he says, ""Rags, Rags." ||| 我隔壁嘅細路仔，5歲， 沖佐入來， 佢同我講，“Rags, Rags” 
 "You know the Hindus are killing us Muslims. Be careful."" I'm like, ""Dude, I'm Hindu."" (Laughter) He's like, ""Huh!"" You know, my work is inspired by events such as this." ||| ”你知唔知印度教滴人系度傻梗我地穆斯林啊，小心滴！“ 我就好似，“呃，我系印度教嘅。” （笑……） 佢就好似，“啊！” 你知，我就系受呢地事情所激發， 做出呢個項目。 
 Even in my gallery shows, I try and revisit historic events like Babri Masjid, distill only its emotional residue and image my own life. ||| 系我嘅畫廊展示入邊， 我都努力重新演繹歷史時間， 就好似巴布里清真寺， 提煉出佢嘅情感沉澱， 再想像出我自己嘅生活。 
 Imagine history being taught differently. ||| 想下，如果歷史唔系甘教嘅。 
 Remember that children's book where you shake and the sexuality of the parents change? ||| 記得我本小兒書嘛？ 當你搖下，父母嘅性別會轉變？ 
 I have another idea. ||| 我仲有個想法。 
 It's a children's book about Indian independence — very patriotic. ||| 呢個系一本小兒書，關於印度獨立—— 好愛國嘅。 
 But when you shake it, you get Pakistan's perspective. ||| 當你搖下，你會有巴基斯坦人嘅角度。 
 Shake it again, and you get the British perspective. ||| 再搖下，你又有英國人嘅角度。 
 (Applause) You have to separate fact from bias, right. ||| （掌聲） 系啦，你要將事實同偏見分開。 
 Even my books on children have cute, fuzzy animals. ||| 我嘅小兒書， 有好得意，毛茸茸嘅動物。 
 But they're playing geopolitics. ||| 不過，佢地玩梗地緣政治。 
 They're playing out Israel-Palestine, India-Pakistan. ||| 佢地扮演佐以色列-巴勒斯坦。 印度-巴基斯坦。 
 You know, I'm making a very important argument. ||| 你知道嗎，我做梗一個很重要嘅宣言。 
 And my argument [is] that the only way for us to teach creativity is by teaching children perspectives at the earliest stage. ||| 就系， 教導如何創新嘅唯一方式， 系最初嘅階段， 就系教卑佢地不同嘅角度。 
 After all, children's books are manuals on parenting, so you better give them children's books that teach them perspectives. ||| 畢竟，小兒書就系大人教導細路仔嘅手冊， 所以你最好卑佢地果地可以教佢地由不同方式睇問題嘅小兒書。 
 And conversely, only when you teach perspectives will a child be able to imagine and put themselves in the shoes of someone who is different from them. ||| 相反， 只有你教佢地不同角度， 細路仔先會有能力去想像， 去切身體會， 同佢地唔一樣嘅人系點想問題嘅。 
 I'm making an argument that art and creativity are very essential tools in empathy. ||| 我要宣稱，藝術同創新， 系培養同情，同感，同理入邊好重要嘅部份。 
 You know, I can't promise my child a life without bias — we're all biased — but I promise to bias my child with multiple perspectives. ||| 你明白，我唔可以保證我嘅子女， 可以完全無偏見—— 我地所有人都有偏見—— 但系，我可以保證，我嘅子女可以從多重角度睇問題。 
 Thank you very much. ||| 非常感谢。 
 (Applause) ||| （掌声） 
 We've kept in touch ever since. ||| 自此之後我哋一直保持聯絡 
 So now it's two years later. ||| 兩年之後，我失業，幾乎破產 
 Why? ||| 點解？ 
 OK, I need you to take out your phones. ||| 好，我需要各位拎出手機 
 Now hand your unlocked phone to the person on your left. ||| 然後將手機交畀你隔籬嘅人 
 Now, how does it feel holding someone's unlocked phone? ||| 宜家攞住人哋解鎖咗嘅手機 感覺如何？ 
 Most of us feel really responsible. ||| 我哋大多數都突然有一種責任感 
 Eventually, we learned to wait until both guests and hosts left the review before we reveal them. ||| 結果我哋知道 我哋至可以公開佢哋嘅評語 
 Now, here's a discovery we made just last week. ||| 就係上星期我哋又學到新嘢 
 Now, that's a natural social bias. ||| 呢個係自然嘅社會偏見現象 
 This is what happens when a guest first messages a host. ||| 跟住落嚟就係房客第一次 畀房東發訊息時嘅情況 
 And third is the existence of a previously unsatisfied need. ||| 第三，之前客戶嘅不滿仍然存在 
 Now, things have been going pretty well. ||| 依家業務發展得唔錯 
 They donated their own blood for his operation. ||| 仲捐血幫佢做手術 
 We do not invest in victims, we invest in survivors. ||| 我哋唔會投資喺受害者身上 我哋投資喺生還者身上 
 And in ways both big and small, the narrative of the victim shapes the way we see women. ||| 無論投資係多定少 受害者嘅故事 影響我哋對女性嘅睇法 
 You can't count what you don't see. ||| 我哋未見過係唔會相信 
 And we don't invest in what's invisible to us. ||| 所以我哋亦唔會投資係見唔到嘅嘢 
 But this is the face of resilience. ||| 但呢个就係 對抗逆境嘅面孔 
 Six years ago, I started writing about women entrepreneurs during and after conflict. ||| 六年前 我開始撰寫關於女性企業家 面對逆境嘅報導 
 I set out to write a compelling economic story, one that had great characters, that no one else was telling, and one that I thought mattered. ||| 我打算寫一個好突出嘅創業故事 一個有豐富人物但未為人知 應該受關注嘅故事 
 And that turned out to be women. ||| 而呢的故事係關於女性 
 I had left ABC news and a career I loved at the age of 30 for business school, a path I knew almost nothing about. ||| 我30歲時離開喜愛嘅工作同ABC新聞廣播 去咗商學院 一個我毫不認識嘅方向 
 None of the women I had grown up with in Maryland had graduated from college, let alone considered business school. ||| 喺馬利蘭州同我一齊成長嘅女性 無一個係大學畢業 更遑論係商學院 
 But they had hustled to feed their kids and pay their rent. ||| 佢哋為口奔馳 為子女, 屋租張羅 
 And I saw from a young age that having a decent job and earning a good living made the biggest difference for families who were struggling. ||| 從小我就睇到 佢哋有一份正當嘅工作去維持生計 為掙扎緊嘅家庭 帶嚟莫大轉變 
 So if you're going to talk about jobs, then you have to talk about entrepreneurs. ||| 講起工作 就先要講企業家 
 And if you're talking about entrepreneurs in conflict and post-conflict settings, then you must talk about women, because they are the population you have left. ||| 講起企業家 點樣面對逆境 就不得不提女性 因為佢地一向都被忽略 
 Rwanda in the immediate aftermath of the genocide was 77 percent female. ||| 在盧旺達，種族屠殺了 百分之77嘅人口係女性 
 I want to introduce you to some of those entrepreneurs I've met and share with you some of what they've taught me over the years. ||| 我想介紹 我遇見嘅女性企業家 以及佢哋一路以嚟教我嘅嘢 
 I went to Afghanistan in 2005 to work on a Financial Times piece, and there I met Kamila, a young women who told me she had just turned down a job with the international community that would have paid her nearly $2,000 a month — an astronomical sum in that context. ||| 2005年喺阿富汗 我為做採訪 我係當地認識咗Kamila 一位剛剛拒絕 國際機構聘請 份工月薪高達2000美元 嘅年輕女子 
 And she had turned it down, she said, because she was going to start her next business, an entrepreneurship consultancy that would teach business skills to men and women all around Afghanistan. ||| 佢拒絕 因為要開展佢嘅事業 提供企業顧問服務 向阿富汗人 傳授營商技巧 
 Business, she said, was critical to her country's future. ||| 佢認為商業發展 對佢國家嘅前途好重要 
 Because long after this round of internationals left, business would help keep her country peaceful and secure. ||| 因為各國撤出阿富汗後 營商可以 為國家帶嚟和平同安全 
 And she said business was even more important for women because earning an income earned respect and money was power for women. ||| 而且對女性尤為重要 因為有收入就令佢哋獲得尊重 對女性嚟講金錢就如權力 
 So I was amazed. ||| 我非常驚喜 
 "I mean here was a girl who had never lived in peace time who somehow had come to sound like a candidate from ""The Apprentice."" (Laughter) So I asked her, ""How in the world do you know this much about business?" ||| "呢位女子從未享受和平嘅生活 聽落仲好似  嘅參加者 (笑聲) 我問佢 ""你點解對做生意知咁多?""" 
 "Why are you so passionate?"" She said, ""Oh Gayle, this is actually my third business." ||| ""咁有熱情?" 佢答我 ""Gayle, 呢個已經係我第3盤生意""" 
 My first business was a dressmaking business I started under the Taliban. ||| ""我第一盤生意係製衣" "係塔利斑管治果陣就開始"" 
 And that was actually an excellent business, because we provided jobs for women all around our neighborhood. ||| ""呢個生意好利害, 因為我哋" "為鄰近嘅婦女提供咗工作"" 
 "And that's really how I became an entrepreneur."" Think about this: Here were girls who braved danger to become breadwinners during years in which they couldn't even be on their streets." ||| ""我就係咁成為企業家" 試諗吓 係果度嘅女仔 冒住生命危險創業 當時佢哋連街都出唔到" 
 And at a time of economic collapse when people sold baby dolls and shoe laces and windows and doors just to survive, these girls made the difference between survival and starvation for so many. ||| 經濟一片蕭條 當其他人只可以 賣洋娃娃, 鞋帶,窗同門 去糊口 呢d女仔已經係 生存同飢餓之間 為好多人帶嚟改變 
 I couldn't leave the story, and I couldn't leave the topic either, because everywhere I went I met more of these women who no one seemed to know about, or even wish to. ||| 我唔可以撇低呢d故事同主題 因我所到之處遇到更多呢類女性 而無人知道 或者無興趣知道 
 "I went on to Bosnia, and early on in my interviews I met with an IMF official who said, ""You know, Gayle, I don't think we actually have women in business in Bosnia, but there is a lady selling cheese nearby on the side of the road." ||| "我之後去波斯尼亞 訪問一位國際貨幣基金組織官員 佢同我講 ""Gayle"" "我唔相信波斯尼亞有女性從事商業" "但路口附近就" "有位女士賣芝士"" 
 "So maybe you could interview her."" So I went out reporting and within a day I met Narcisa Kavazovic who at that point was opening a new factory on the war's former front lines in Sarajevo." ||| ""或者你可以訪問吓佢" 於是我繼續做採訪 當日我遇到Narcisa Kavazovic 佢正喺昔日薩拉熱窩戰綫上面 經營緊一間新工廠" 
 She had started her business squatting in an abandoned garage, sewing sheets and pillow cases she would take to markets all around the city so that she could support the 12 or 13 family members who were counting on her for survival. ||| 佢係棄置嘅車房 開創事業 專做床單同枕頭袋嘅車工 之後帶去全市嘅市場售賣 嚟支撐 一個靠佢收入嘅 12至13人嘅屋企 
 By the time we met, she had 20 employees, most of them women, who were sending their boys and their girls to school. ||| 當時佢有20個員工 大部分係女性 佢哋嘅子女已經求學途中 
 And she was just the start. ||| Narcisa只係一個開始 
 I met women running essential oils businesses, wineries and even the country's largest advertising agency. ||| 我遇見不同嘅女性, 有售賣精油 有售賣酒類 甚至有經營全國最大廣告商 
 So these stories together became the Herald Tribune business cover. ||| 所有呢的故事 成為嘅報導 
 And when this story posted, I ran to my computer to send it to the IMF official. ||| 當佢哋一登出 我即刻send比果位官員 
 "And I said, ""Just in case you're looking for entrepreneurs to feature at your next investment conference, here are a couple of women."" (Applause) But think about this." ||| "我話 ""如果你要為下次嘅 投資會搵企業家 呢度就有一群女性企業家"" (掌聲) 但再諗吓" 
 The IMF official is hardly the only person to automatically file women under micro. ||| 果位官員未必係唯一 睇少女性嘅人 
 The biases, whether intentional or otherwise, are pervasive, and so are the misleading mental images. ||| 呢種偏見, 不論係咪故意, 都係無處不在 仲有我地固有嘅印像 
 "If you see the word ""microfinance,"" what comes to mind?" ||| "當你睇到""微型金融"" 你哋有咩聯想?" 
 Most people say women. ||| 好多人諗到女性 
 "And if you see the word ""entrepreneur,"" most people think men." ||| "但如果睇到 ""企業家"" 大部份人會諗到男性" 
 Why is that? ||| 點解呢? 
 Because we aim low and we think small when it comes to women. ||| 因為一提到女性 我地諗起卑微, 弱小 
 Microfinance is an incredibly powerful tool that leads to self-sufficiency and self-respect, but we must move beyond micro-hopes and micro-ambitions for women, because they have so much greater hopes for themselves. ||| 微型金融係一個強而有力嘅工具 可以帶嚟自給自足同自我尊重 但我哋必須拋低對女性 低估咗嘅希望同抱負 因為佢哋對自己有更大嘅希望 
 They want to move from micro to medium and beyond. ||| 佢哋想從微小伸展至更遠 
 And in many places, they're there. ||| 係多範疇入面 佢哋都係度 
 In the U.S., women-owned businesses will create five and a half million new jobs by 2018. ||| 喺美國, 由女性創業嘅公司 會係2018年前創造550萬職位 
 In South Korea and Indonesia, women own nearly half a million firms. ||| 係南韓同印尼 女性就擁有近50萬間公司 
 China, women run 20 percent of all small businesses. ||| 喺中國, 女性經營嘅 小企業就佔百分之20 
 And in the developing world overall, That figure is 40 to 50 percent. ||| 喺發展中國家 呢個數目更達至百分至40至50 
 Nearly everywhere I go, I meet incredibly interesting entrepreneurs who are seeking access to finance, access to markets and established business networks. ||| 差不多我所到之處 我都可以遇到了不起嘅企業家 佢哋尋求融資, 開拓市場 同建立網絡 
 They are often ignored because they're harder to help. ||| 但佢哋被忽視 因為好難向佢哋提供協助 
 It is much riskier to give a 50,000 dollar loan than it is to give a 500 dollar loan. ||| 5萬蚊借貸比500蚊借貸 更加冒險 
 And as the World Bank recently noted, women are stuck in a productivity trap. ||| 世界銀行最近指出 女性墮入生產力嘅陷阱 
 Those in small businesses can't get the capital they need to expand and those in microbusiness can't grow out of them. ||| 經營小企業嘅 得唔到資金擴展業務 果d係更小型嘅生意 得唔到發展 
 Recently I was at the State Department in Washington and I met an incredibly passionate entrepreneur from Ghana. ||| 最近我喺美國國務院 遇到一位嚟自加納嘅女企業家 
 She sells chocolates. ||| 佢係售賣朱古力嘅 
 And she had come to Washington, not seeking a handout and not seeking a microloan. ||| 佢嚟到 唔係為咗學嘢或者貸款 
 She had come seeking serious investment dollars so that she could build the factory and buy the equipment she needs to export her chocolates to Africa, Europe, the Middle East and far beyond — capital that would help her to employ more than the 20 people that she already has working for her, and capital that would fuel her own country's economic climb. ||| 而係嚟搵資金 去起工廠 同買機器 生產朱古力 出口去非洲, 歐洲同中東 佢要求嘅資金 係可以令佢繼續 聘請一群 超過20人嘅在職員工 同時可以幫佢係國家經濟 蓬勃嘅時候繼續發展 
 The great news is we already know what works. ||| 令人興奮嘅 係我哋知咩嘢係有用 
 Theory and empirical evidence Have already taught us. ||| 因為理論同數據 向我哋証明咗 
 We don't need to invent solutions because we have them — cash flow loans based in income rather than assets, loans that use secure contracts rather than collateral, because women often don't own land. ||| 唔需要解決辦法, 因為 我哋已經有 根據收入而唔係資產 可以幫佢哋簽到合約而唔係要嚟善後嘅錢 因為佢哋無土地做抵押 
 And Kiva.org, the microlender, is actually now experimenting with crowdsourcing small and medium sized loans. ||| Kiva.org 呢個微型貸款機構 就係試驗緊呢種 小型至中型嘅借貸 
 And that's just to start. ||| 呢個只係開始 
 "Recently it has become very much in fashion to call women ""the emerging market of the emerging market."" I think that is terrific." ||| "最近好流行講 女性係 ""新興市場中嘅新興市場"" 我認為無得頂" 
 You know why? ||| 點解呢? 
 Because — and I say this as somebody who worked in finance — 500 billion dollars at least has gone into the emerging markets in the past decade. ||| 因為據我呢行嘅朋友講 係過去10年有5000億美金 就注入咗呢類新興市場 
 Because investors saw the potential for return at a time of slowing economic growth, and so they created financial products and financial innovation tailored to the emerging markets. ||| 因為投資者係經濟放緩嘅時勢 睇到有回報嘅潛力 所以佢哋設計咗為新興市場 而設嘅金融產品 同創新模式 
 How wonderful would it be if we were prepared to replace all of our lofty words with our wallets and invest 500 billion dollars unleashing women's economic potential? ||| 所以我哋如果可以 放低成見 而將5000億 投放係女性嘅經濟動力 係幾咁好呢? 
 Just think of the benefits when it comes to jobs, productivity, employment, child nutrition, maternal mortality, literacy and much, much more. ||| 想像吓呢的資金 對職位, 生產力, 就業, 下一代嘅飲食, 產婦死亡率, 讀寫能力 同更多嘅得益有幾大 
 Because, as the World Economic Forum noted, smaller gender gaps are directly correlated with increased economic competitiveness. ||| 因為世界經濟論壇指出 越少性別差距, 越可以 提高經濟競爭力 
 And not one country in all the world has eliminated its economic participation gap — not one. ||| 無一個國家 完全可以填補兩性參予經濟活動上嘅差距 絕對無 
 So the great news is this is an incredible opportunity. ||| 於是呢個 就係一個大好機會喇 
 We have so much room to grow. ||| 我哋仲有好多發展空間 
 So you see, this is not about doing good, this is about global growth and global employment. ||| 所以 呢個唔係為咗做好事 而係為咗全球嘅發展 同就業市場 
 It is about how we invest and it's about how we see women. ||| 係關於我地點投資 同點看待女性 
 And women can no longer be both half the population and a special interest group. ||| 女性已經唔只係 一半人口 同小眾利益 
 "(Applause) Oftentimes I get into very interesting discussions with reporters who say to me, ""Gayle, these are great stories, but you're really writing about the exceptions."" Now that makes me pause for just a couple reasons." ||| "(掌聲) 我經常都同同行討論 佢哋話 ""Gayle, 呢d報導係好正"" "但你只係寫緊的特殊例子" 我真係因為而停落嚟" 
 First of all, for exceptions, there are a lot of them and they're important. ||| 首先, 所謂特殊例子 真係有好多 亦好緊要 
 Secondly, when we talk about men who are succeeding, we rightly consider them icons or pioneers or innovators to be emulated. ||| 第二, 當我哋講成功嘅男士 我哋會以佢哋為 代表人物, 先駒 或者 有創意嘅人 學習對像 
 And when we talk about women, they are either exceptions to be dismissed or aberrations to be ignored. ||| 但一講女性 我哋就當佢地只係例外 或者奇人咁去忽視 
 And finally, there is no society anywhere in all the world that is not changed except by its most exceptional. ||| 最終 無一個國家 唔係因為呢類好特別 嘅例子而改變 
 So why wouldn't we celebrate and elevate these change makers and job creators rather than overlook them? ||| 點解我哋唔為呢的特殊例子 創造就業嘅人去鼓掌 反而對佢地視而不見? 
 This topic of resilience is very personal to me and in many ways has shaped my life. ||| 呢個充滿韌力嘅主題係對我好有意義 係多方面改變我嘅生活 
 My mom was a single mom who worked at the phone company during the day and sold Tupperware at night so that I could have every opportunity possible. ||| 我媽媽係一位單親媽媽 佢日頭係電話公司工作 夜晚售賣食物儲存盒 令我可以接觸所有機會 
 We shopped double coupons and layaway and consignment stores, and when she got sick with stage four breast cancer and could no longer work, we even applied for food stamps. ||| 我哋盡量用優惠卷買嘢 亦用分期供款或買二手貨 當我媽媽患乳癌到咗末期 唔可以再做嘢 我哋甚至要申請資助 
 "And when I would feel sorry for myself as nine or 10 year-old girls do, she would say to me, ""My dear, on a scale of major world tragedies, yours is not a three."" (Laughter) And when I was applying to business school and felt certain I couldn't do it and nobody I knew had done it, I went to my aunt who survived years of beatings at the hand of her husband and escaped a marriage of abuse with only her dignity intact." ||| "當時我大概9, 10歲 我覺得自己好可憐 媽媽會同我講 ""乖女, 同世界上嘅 慘劇相比, 你算老幾呀"" (笑聲) 當我準備考商學院 我覺得自己無咩機會 亦無人知我去咗考 我去咗搵我阿姨, 佢好不幸長被丈夫打 最終離開咗呢段婚姻 身心幸存" 
 "And she told me, "Never import other people's limitations."" ||| "佢同我講 "千祁唔好比其他人限制咗你"" 
 "And when I complained to my grandmother, a World War II veteran who worked in film for 50 years and who supported me from the age of 13, that I was terrified that if I turned down a plum assignment at ABC for a fellowship overseas, I would never ever, ever find another job, she said, ""Kiddo, I'm going to tell you two things." ||| "我又去搵婆婆呻 佢經歷過二戰 係電影工業做咗半個世紀 係我13歲開始就照顧我 我呻話我驚 驚如果我為咗去外國深造 而放棄ABC 呢份荀工 我以後都唔會再搵嘢做 佢講, ""阿妹, 我講你知兩樣嘢""" 
 "First of all, no one turns down a Fulbright, and secondly, McDonald's is always hiring."" (Laughter) "You will find a job. Take the leap."" ||| ""第一,唔會有人放棄交流嘅機會" "第二, 麥記成日都請人㗎" (笑聲) "你會搵到工嘅, 放膽去啦"" 
 The women in my family are not exceptions. ||| 我屋企嘅女性 並唔係特殊例子 
 The women in this room and watching in L.A. ||| 係呢個講座同係L.A.睇轉播嘅女性 
 and all around the world are not exceptions. ||| 仲有全球各哋嘅 都唔係咩特殊例子 
 We are not a special interest group. ||| 我哋唔係小數 
 We are the majority. ||| 而係大多數 
 And for far too long, we have underestimated ourselves and been undervalued by others. ||| 我哋經常 低估自己 亦被人輕視 
 It is time for us to aim higher when it comes to women, to invest more and to deploy our dollars to benefit women all around the world. ||| 作為女性, 係時候要望高的遠的 投資多的去 令全世界嘅女性受益 
 We can make a difference, and make a difference, not just for women, but for a global economy that desperately needs their contributions. ||| 我哋有能力轉變 唔單止為女性 而係為咗全球經濟 極度需要佢哋嘅貢獻 
 Together we can make certain that the so-called exceptions begin to rule. ||| 我哋一齊有能力 去令呢類所謂例外 變成主導 
 When we change the way we see ourselves, others will follow. ||| 當我哋對自己睇法改變 其他人亦會咁做 
 And it is time for all of us to think bigger. ||| 我哋係時候 去想得更遠大 
 Thank you very much. ||| 多謝各位 
 (Applause) ||| (掌聲) 
 And he wadded up the clay horse and he threw it back in the bin. ||| 將黏土馬搓埋一舊，揼咗落垃圾桶度 
 And I wonder how often that happens. ||| 但我想問佢呢種事係唔係幾常發生 
 That you don't do things, you're afraid you're going to be judged. ||| 即係你唔做嘢係因為驚被人審 
 If you don't say the right creative thing, you're going to be judged. ||| 你怕因為講唔出 「正確創意嘅嘢」而被審 
 But at one point he had a moment of crisis. ||| 但係有一次，佢經歷過一刹那嘅危機 
 He was in the hospital looking at one of his MRI machines in use when he saw a young family. ||| 當佢喺醫院睇住佢設計嘅 磁力共振掃描機運作 佢遇見一個年輕家庭 
 He was saving lives with this machine. ||| 佢以為佢一直用緊呢部機拯救生命 
 And they talk to them about the noise and the movement of the ship. ||| 職員會將噪音同埋機器包裝成一個故事 
 And the hospital and GE were happy too. ||| 醫院同通用電氣都好高興 
 Because you didn't have to call the anesthesiologist all the time, they could put more kids through the machine in a day. ||| 因為唔使每次都叫埋麻醉師嚟 而且日日又可以同多啲細路檢查 
 He was with one of the mothers waiting for her child to come out of the scan. ||| 於是佢陪其中一個媽媽 等佢個細路女掃描完出嚟 
 "And when the little girl came out of her scan, she ran up to her mother and said, "Mommy, can we come back tomorrow?"" ||| 當細路女出嚟嘅時候 細路女走去媽媽度，問媽媽 「媽咪，我哋聽日可唔可以再嚟過呀？」 
 Doug's story takes place in a hospital. ||| Doug Dietz 嘅故事喺醫院發生 
 I was told I had a 40 percent chance of survival. ||| 有人同我講，我嘅生存率剩得四成 
 Mostly you think about, Am I going to survive? ||| 你哋經常諗嘅係，我會唔會生存落去？ 
 And so there were lots of projects that I could work on. ||| 所以我有好多項目可以做 
 We see people quit what they're doing and go in new directions. ||| 我哋見到啲人唔再做舊嘅嘢 
 Everybody has a change-the-world thing. ||| 每個人都有啲嘢想改變世界 
 Today I am going to teach you how to play my favorite game: massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling. ||| 今日我要教你哋 點去玩我最鍾意嘅遊戲︰ 大型多人手指公摔角 
 So this sounds pretty good, right? Now you're willing to play. ||| 聽落唔錯，係咪？ 你哋都想玩嘅 
 So thank you, Monochrom. ||| 所以多謝你 Monochrom 
 Okay, so most people are familiar with traditional, two-person thumb-wrestling. ||| 好啦，咁好多人其實都熟悉 傳統嘅二人手指公摔角 
 Sunni, let's just remind them. ||| Sunni，等我哋幫大家溫習一下 
 Now the first thing about massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling, we're the gamer generation. ||| 玩大型多人拇指摔角 要注意嘅第一件事係 我哋係遊戲世代 
 There are a billion gamers on the planet now, so we need more of a challenge. ||| 現時全球有十億個玩家 所以我哋唔止需要挑戰 
 So the first thing we need is more thumbs. ||| 咁我哋需要嘅第一樣野嘢 
 So Eric, come on over. ||| 所以，Eric，過來 
 So we could get three thumbs together, and Peter could join us. ||| 我哋可以將三隻手指公擺埋一齊 Peter 都可以加入來 
 We could even have four thumbs together, and the way you win is you're the first person to pin someone else's thumb. ||| 我哋甚至可以四個手指公一齊 而贏嘅方法 就係你係第一個壓住是旦一個嘅手指 
 That is not how you win. ||| 你唔可以咁贏 
 Ah, who did that? Eric you did that. ||| 啊，邊個壓住手指？Eric 係你 
 So Eric would have won. He was the first person to pin my thumb. ||| 所以 Eric 頭先就贏咗 
 Okay, so that's the first rule, and we can see that three or four is kind of the typical number of thumbs in a node, but if you feel ambitious, you don't have to hold back. ||| 好啦，呢個係第一條規則 咁我哋可以睇到 3 或者 4 係通常一局嘅人數 但如果你雄心壯志 
 So you can see up here. ||| 你睇呢度 
 Now the only other rule you need to remember is, gamer generation, we like a challenge. ||| 唯一另一條你需要記得嘅規則係 遊戲世代啊嘛，我哋鍾意挑戰 
 And if we had just four people, we would do it just like this, and we would try and wrestle both thumbs at the same time. ||| 所以如果我哋得四個人 我哋可以咁樣玩 而我哋就可以試下 同時用兩隻手指公摔角 
 Perfect. ||| 非常好 
 Now, if we had more people in the room, instead of just wrestling in a closed node, we might reach out and try and grab some other people. ||| 呢家呢，如果我哋係房裡面有更加多人 與其形成一個剩係得四個人玩 我哋可以捉埋其他人隻手 
 And in fact, that's what we're going to do right now. ||| 呢個就係我哋宜家要做嘅嘢 
 We're going to try and get all, something like, I don't know, 1,500 thumbs in this room connected in a single node. ||| 我哋要試下將所有房裏面嘅指隻公 我唔知有幾多，大概有 1,500 隻 全部連埋一齊 
 And we have to connect both levels, so if you're up there, you're going to be reaching down and reaching up. ||| 而且我哋要連接兩層 如果你喺側邊，你要 向下伸手或者向上伸手 
 Now — (Laughter) — before we get started — This is great. You're excited to play. — before we get started, can I have the slides back up here really quick, because if you get good at this game, I want you to know there are some advanced levels. ||| 好啦（笑聲） 係我哋開始之前… 宜家氣氛唔錯，你哋都好興奮 我哋開始之前，我要頭先張投影片 因為當你玩呢個遊戲、玩得唔錯嘅時候 我想話畀你哋知，仲有一個高級玩法 
 So this is the kind of simple level, right? ||| 呢個其實係入門等級 
 But there are advanced configurations. ||| 但其實仲有高級玩法 
 This is called the Death Star Configuration. ||| 呢個係死星結構玩法 
 Any Star Wars fans? ||| 有冇星球大戰嘅影迷？ 
 And this one's called the Möbius Strip. ||| 呢個叫「梅比斯環」 
 So we'll stick with the normal one for now, and I'm going to give you 30 seconds, every thumb into the node, connect the upper and the lower levels, you guys go on down there. ||| 不過我哋做簡單嘅先 我會畀 30 秒你哋 將所有手指公都連埋一齊 連起上下兩層 你哋行去嗰邊 
 Thirty seconds. Into the network. Make the node. ||| 30 秒連成一個網 
 Stand up! It's easier if you stand up. ||| 企起身！企起身會容易啲 
 Everybody, up up up up up! ||| 所有人起身！起身！起身！ 
 Stand up, my friends. ||| 企起身，各位 
 All right. ||| 好 
 Don't start wrestling yet. ||| 唔好開始住 
 If you have a free thumb, wave it around to make sure. ||| 如果你有多出嘅手指公就周圍郁下 
 Grab that thumb! ||| 捉住手指公！ 
 Reach behind you. There you go. ||| 去你後面，非常好 
 Any other thumbs? ||| 仲有冇其他手指公？ 
 Okay, on the count of three, you're going to go. ||| 好，我數三下，你哋就開始 
 Try to keep track. Grab, grab, grab it. ||| 記得你手指公嘅位置。捉，捉，捉住！ 
 Okay? One, two, three, go! ||| 得未？一，二，三，開始！ 
 (Laughter) Did you win? You got it? You got it? Excellent! ||| （笑聲） 你贏咗？你捉到？你捉到？非常好！ 
 (Applause) Well done. Thank you. Thank you very much. ||| （掌聲） 好好啊。多謝晒。多謝你哋 
 All right. ||| 好啦 
 "I said ""massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling."" You were like, ""What the hell is she talking about?"" So I provoked a little curiosity." ||| 當我話「大型多人手指公摔角」 你哋就諗，佢究竟講緊咩呀 所以我引起咗小小好奇心 
 Creativity: it took creativity to solve the problem of getting all the thumbs into the node. ||| 創意：你哋需要創意去 將所有手指公連埋一齊 
 I'm reaching around and I'm reaching up. ||| 我要周圍揾或者向上揾 
 So you used creativity. That was great. ||| 所以你哋用咗創意。非常好 
 You heard that sound go up in the room. ||| 你哋可以聽到 房入面嘅聲音都提高咗 
 We had excitement. As you started to wrestle, maybe you're starting to win or this person's, like, really into it, so you kind of get the excitement going. ||| 我哋有刺激。當你開始摔角時 可能一邊你就嚟贏，但對手都好似就嚟贏 所以你可以一直感受到刺激 
 We had joy. You were laughing, smiling. Look at your faces. This room is full of joy. ||| 我哋有快樂，你哋一直喺度笑 
 We had some contentment. ||| 我哋有投入 
 I didn't see anybody sending text messages or checking their email while we were playing, so you were totally content to be playing. ||| 我冇見到有人喺摔角時候 發短信或者睇郵件 所以你哋完全投入呢個遊戲 
 You guys were all holding hands for way more than six seconds, so we are all now biochemically primed to love each other. That is great. ||| 你哋大家都捉住大家嘅手 所以我哋都喺生理上準備好 去接受每一個人。呢個非常好 
 And the last emotion of pride. ||| 最後係自豪 
 How many people are like me. Just admit it. ||| 幾多人好似我咁。唔好怕羞 
 You lost both your thumbs. ||| 邊個兩隻手指公都輸咗？ 
 It just didn't work out for you. ||| 呢個遊戲就係唔啱你 
 That's okay, because you learned a new skill today. ||| 但無所謂。因為你今日學咗新技能 
 You learned, from scratch, a game you never knew before. ||| 你從乜都唔知，唔知遊戲點玩 
 So congratulations. ||| 所以恭喜你 
 All right. I have very good news for you. ||| 好。我有好消息要話畀你知 
 Because there aren't that many people who know how to play, we have to kind of accelerate the program more than a game like chess. ||| 因為仲有好多人 都未知點玩呢個遊戲 我哋要加快呢個遊戲嘅推廣 要比象棋仲傳得更廣 
 So congratulations, grandmasters. ||| 所以恭喜晒，大師嘅你哋 
 Win one thumb once, you will become a grandmaster. ||| 只要贏咗一隻手指公，你就係大師啦 
 Did anybody win both their thumbs? ||| 有無人兩隻都贏？ 
 Yes. Awesome. Okay. ||| 哇。好！ 
 Get ready to update your Twitter or Facebook status. ||| 準備更新你 Twitter 或者 Facebook 狀態 
 You guys, according to the rules, are legendary grandmasters, so congratulations. ||| 根據指引 你哋喺傳奇級大師，所以恭喜你哋！ 
 I will just leave you with this tip, if you want to play again. ||| 如果你哋以後仲想玩 我畀個提示你 
 The best way to become a legendary grandmaster, you've got your two nodes going on. ||| 成為傳奇級大師嘅最好辦法 就係你兩邊都同時進行比賽 
 Pick off the one that looks easiest. ||| 先玩簡單嘅一邊 
 They're not paying attention. They look kind of weak. ||| 佢哋唔認真玩，或者佢哋睇起嚟渣 
 Focus on that one and do something crazy with this arm. ||| 專注嗰隻 跟住用另一邊手臂 做超誇張嘅動作 
 As soon as you win, suddenly stop. ||| 當你贏，就即刻停低 
 Everybody is thrown off. You go in for the kill. ||| 每一個人都反應唔切，你就趁機贏佢哋 
 That's how you become a legendary grandmaster of massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling. ||| 呢個就係你點樣成為 遊戲嘅傳奇級大師 
 Wooo! (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) ||| （歡呼聲、掌聲） 多謝 （掌聲） 
 When I was a kid, the disaster we worried about most  was a nuclear war. ||| 當我仲係一個細路仔 核戰係我哋最擔心嘅災難 
 That's why we had a barrel like this down in our basement, filled with cans of food and water. ||| 於是我哋喺地下室擺咗一個桶 桶裡面裝住好多罐頭同埋水 
 When the nuclear attack came, we were supposed to go downstairs, hunker down, and eat out of that barrel. ||| 假如核戰爆發 我哋就落去地下室匿埋 然後靠果個桶維生 
 Today the greatest risk  of global catastrophe doesn't look like this. ||| 當今世上風險最大既災難 唔係呢個 
 Instead, it looks like this. ||| 而係呢個 
 If anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades, it's most likely to be  a highly infectious virus rather than a war. ||| 假如有樣野可以係喺未來幾十年 殺死超過一千萬人 最有可能嘅就係傳染性極高嘅病毒 而並非戰爭 
 Not missiles, but microbes. ||| 唔係導彈，而係微生物 
 Let's look at Ebola. ||| 睇下伊波拉 
 And as you look at what went on, the problem wasn't that there was a system that didn't work well enough, the problem was that we  didn't have a system at all. ||| 從事件嘅發展我哋睇度 問題唔係機制運作唔好 而係我哋根本冇一個機制去應對伊波拉 
 In fact, there's some pretty obvious key missing pieces. ||| 事實上係有一啲幾明顯嘅漏洞 
 We didn't have a group of epidemiologists  ready to go, who would have gone, seen what the disease was, seen how far it had spread. ||| 我們冇一班隨時候命嘅流行病學家 喺傳染病爆發嗰陣去研究 個病毒本身屬性係點，傳播規模有幾大 
 The case reports came in on paper. ||| 病例報告雖然以書面形式發表 
 It was very delayed before they were put online and they were extremely inaccurate. ||| 但好耐之後佢哋先至放上網 啲報告仲要係好唔準確 
 We didn't have a way of preparing people. ||| 我哋冇辦法招募到人員 
 Now, Médecins Sans Frontières  did a great job orchestrating volunteers. ||| 無國界醫生喺組織志願者方面 貢獻咗好多 
 But even so, we were far slower than we should have been getting the thousands of workers into these countries. ||| 即使係咁，我哋仍然比應有嘅步伐慢 我哋宜家喺呢啲有疫情嘅國家度 應該要有幾千個人員 
 There was no one there  to look at treatment approaches. ||| 冇人試過睇下治療方法 
 No one to look at the diagnostics. ||| 冇人留意過診斷方式 
 No one to figure out  what tools should be used. ||| 冇人試過探討用咩工具 
 As an example, we could have  taken the blood of survivors, processed it, and put that plasma back in people to protect them. ||| 舉例，我哋可以抽取康復者嘅血液 處理過之後 將血清注入番佢哋度去保護佢哋 
 But that was never tried. ||| 但冇人試過咁做 
 So there was a lot that was missing. ||| 所以，真係有好多地方做得不足 
 And these things  are really a global failure. ||| 呢啲就係全球既失敗 
 The WHO is funded to monitor epidemics, but not to do these things I talked about. ||| 世界衛生組織本身就係去監控疫情 但偏偏佢哋從來都冇做過 
 Now, in the movies it's quite different. ||| 喺電影裡面，情況就唔一樣 
 There's a group of handsome epidemiologists ready to go, they move in, they save the day, but that's just pure Hollywood. ||| 裡面有一班隨時準備就緒嘅流行病學家 佢哋介入，拯救咗全世界 不過呢啲只係電影情節 
 About 10,000 people died, and nearly all were in the three West African countries. ||| 有大約一萬人死亡 幾乎全部都係黎自西非三個國家 
 There's three reasons why it didn't spread more. ||| 疫情之所以冇進一步擴大 原因有三個 
 The first is that there was a lot  of heroic work by the health workers. ||| 第一個原因係 有好多英勇既醫護人員喺度奮鬥 
 They found the people and they  prevented more infections. ||| 佢哋發現患者之後 就第一時間阻止疫情傳開 
 The second is the nature of the virus. ||| 第二就係病毒本身嘅特性 
 Ebola does not spread through the air. ||| 伊波拉唔會經空氣傳播 
 And by the time you're contagious, most people are so sick  that they're bedridden. ||| 當你具備高傳染性嘅時候 大多數人因為病得好嚴重 要訓喺張床度 
 Third, it didn't get into many urban areas. ||| 第三，病毒冇傳到去多個城市 
 And that was just luck. ||| 呢個只係好彩 
 If it had gotten into a lot  more urban areas, the case numbers  would have been much larger. ||| 如果病毒擴散到更多城市 病例數目就會多好多 
 So next time, we might not be so lucky. ||| 下次我哋未必會咁好彩 
 You can have a virus where people  feel well enough while they're infectious that they get on a plane or they go to a market. ||| 一個人可以帶住病毒但又冇事 只要呢個人上機或者去街市 都可以將病毒傳開去 
 The source of the virus could be  a natural epidemic like Ebola, or it could be bioterrorism. ||| 病毒嘅源頭可以係自然既流行病 好似伊波拉咁 亦可以係黎自生物恐怖主義 
 So there are things that would literally make things a thousand times worse. ||| 所以，事情往往可以造成千倍更大嘅傷害 
 In fact, let's look at a model of a virus spread through the air, like the Spanish Flu back in 1918. ||| 我地一齊黎睇一個 病毒經空氣傳播嘅模型 就好似 1918 年西班牙流感病毒咁 
 And you can see over 30 million people died from that epidemic. ||| 大約有三千萬死於呢場疫症 
 So this is a serious problem. ||| 嗰次疫症真係好嚴重 
 We should be concerned. ||| 我哋必須多加關注 
 But in fact, we can build a really good response system. ||| 不過，其實 我哋係可以建立一個完善嘅應變系統 
 We have the benefits of all the science and technology that we talk about here. ||| 科學同科技帶比大家嘅好處 我哋已經喺度講過 
 We've got cell phones to get information from the public  and get information out to them. ||| 我哋都有手機 可以接收大眾資訊 亦可以向公眾發放訊息 
 We have satellite maps where we can see where people are and where they're moving. ||| 我哋可以透衛星地圖睇到 啲人嘅位置同佢哋行緊去邊 
 We have advances in biology that should dramatically change  the turnaround time to look at a pathogen and be able to make drugs and vaccines that fit for that pathogen. ||| 人類喺生物學上取得嘅成果 應該可以俾人 有更多時間去尋找致病源 去研製藥物同疫苗黎對付致病源 
 And we need preparedness. ||| 仲有一樣野，就係我哋需要準備 
 For soldiers, we have full-time, waiting to go. ||| 士兵整束待發 
 We have reserves that can scale  us up to large numbers. ||| 大批後備軍隊支援 
 NATO has a mobile unit  that can deploy very rapidly. ||| 北約有一個可以迅速部署嘅部隊 
 NATO does a lot of war games  to check, are people well trained? ||| 北約舉行好多嘅演習 確保軍隊訓綀有素 
 Do they understand  about fuel and logistics and the same radio frequencies? ||| 例如佢哋熟唔熟悉燃料同行動 通訊用嘅頻率係唔係一樣 
 So they are absolutely ready to go. ||| 務求佢哋係準備就緒 
 So those are the kinds of things we need to deal with an epidemic. ||| 所以呢啲都係我哋應對疫情既問題 
 What are the key pieces? ||| 咁關鍵係嘜？ 
 First, we need strong health systems in poor countries. ||| 首先，貧窮國家需要有規模嘅衛生體系 
 That's where mothers  can give birth safely, kids can get all their vaccines. ||| 可以俾母親安全生產 細路可以接種疫苗 
 But, also where we'll see  the outbreak very early on. ||| 但係，喺我哋將會見到 最先出現疫情既地方 
 And then we need to pair those medical people with the military. ||| 跟住需要醫護人員同軍隊合作 
 The last time a germ game  was done in the United States was back in 2001,  and it didn't go so well. ||| 最近一次喺美國進行嘅細菌模擬爆發測試 係喺 2001 年 不過嗰次進行嘚得唔係好順利 
 So far the score is germs: 1, people: 0. ||| 嗰次，細菌同人類嘅比分係 1:0 
 Finally, we need lots of advanced R&D in areas of vaccines and diagnostics. ||| 最後，我哋喺疫苗同診斷方面需要有大量嘅研發 
 The World Bank estimates that  if we have a worldwide flu epidemic, global wealth will go down by over three trillion dollars and we'd have millions and millions of deaths. ||| 世界銀行預測，假如全球流感大爆發 全球財富將會唔見三兆億美元 會有幾百萬人死亡 
 These investments  offer significant benefits beyond just being ready for the epidemic. ||| 健康科學嘅投資會帶黎好多好處 唔單止係預防疫情爆發 
 The primary healthcare, the R&D, those things would reduce  global health equity and make the world more just  as well as more safe. ||| 基本醫療、研發 呢啲都會減低全球衛生嘅平等性 令世界變得更公平更安全 
 So I think this should absolutely be a priority. ||| 所以我認為呢樣野絕對係首要考慮既事情 
 We don't have to hoard cans of spaghetti or go down into the basement. ||| 我哋其實唔需要喺地下室 囤積好多意大利麵嘅罐頭 
 But we need to get going, because time is not on our side. ||| 但係我哋要立即行動 因為時間唔到我哋控制 
 In fact, if there's one positive thing that can come out of the Ebola epidemic, it's that it can serve as an early  warning, a wake-up call, to get ready. ||| 事實上，假如我哋要正面睇伊波拉疫情 就會知道伊波拉其實係一個警號 話俾人類知要未雨綢謬 
 If we start now, we can be ready  for the next epidemic. ||| 如果大家從宜家就開始行動 
 "When he saw the site, he asked, ""This is an impossible dream." ||| 當佢睇到嗰個遺跡，佢問︰ 「呢個係冇可能嘅，點解會搵到嘅呢？」 
 (Cheers) We will do nothing less than use state-of-the-art technology to map an entire country. ||| （歡呼聲） 我哋會用到最先進科技 描繪成個國家嘅地形 
 This is a dream started by Hiram Bingham, but we are expanding it to the world, making archaeological exploration more open, inclusive, and at a scale simply not previously possible. ||| 呢一個夢係由 Hiram Bingham 開始嘅 但我哋將個夢延伸到全世界 令更多地方都可以有考古 亦令到考古規模更加大 
 (Applause) Thank you. ||| （掌聲） 多謝 
 So Peru doesn't just have Machu Picchu. ||| 秘魯唔單只有馬丘比丘 
 It has absolutely stunning jewelry, like what you can see here. ||| 仲有精緻嘅珠寶 就好似你喺呢度睇到嘅咁 
 It has amazing Moche pottery of human figures. ||| 有栩栩如生嘅 Moche 陶土人偶 
 It has the Nazca Lines and amazing textiles. ||| 有納斯卡線條 同令人驚歎嘅紡織品 
 So as part of the TED Prize platform, we are going to partnering with some incredible organizations, first of all with DigitalGlobe, the world's largest provider of high-resolution commercial satellite imagery. ||| 按著 TED 大獎嘅計劃嚟到做 我哋打算同一啲組織合作 首先同 DigitalGlobe 世界上最大嘅高分辨率 商用衛星圖像供應商 
 They're going to be helping us build out this amazing crowdsourcing platform they have. ||| 佢哋會幫我哋建立 呢個佢哋有嘅眾包平台 
 Of course, they'll also be providing us with the satellite imagery. ||| 當然，佢哋都會提供衛星圖像 
 We've already begun to build and plan the platform, and I'm just so excited. ||| 我哋已經開始咗建立同設計平台 而我依家好興奮 
 So here's the cool part. ||| 跟住落嚟仲勁︰ 
 My team, headed up by Chase Childs, is already beginning to look at some of the satellite imagery. ||| 由 Chase Childs 帶領嘅團隊 已經開始查緊一啲衛星圖像 
 Of course, what you can see here is 0.3-meter data. ||| 當然，你依家睇到嘅係 長 0.3 米嘅地面 
 This is site called Chan Chan in northern Peru. ||| 呢個就係秘魯北部 稱為 Chan Chan 嘅遺跡 
 It dates to 850 AD. ||| 可以追溯到公元 850 年 
 And we've already begun to find previously unknown sites. ||| 仲有我哋已經開始搵早前未知嘅遺跡 
 Unfortunately, we've also begun to uncover large-scale looting at sites, like what you see here. ||| 不幸嘅係，我哋亦都喺遺跡發現 就好似你哋依家睇到咁樣 
 We'll be collaborating closely with them. ||| 我哋之間將會有密切合作 
 He also runs this amazing drone mapping program, some of the images of which you can see behind me here and here. ||| 佢亦都開展緊無人機地圖測繪計劃 喺我背後睇到你可以見到其中一啲圖像 
 And this data will be incorporated into the platform, and also he'll be helping to image some of the new sites you help find. ||| 而呢啲數據會被收入平臺之中 佢同時會描繪新遺跡，等你可以幫手搵 
 Some of you may not be aware that some of the world's poorest communities coexist with some of the world's most well-known archaeological sites. ||| 你哋可能唔知啦 世界上嘅一啲最貧窮嘅社區 其實喺一啲最出名嘅考古遺跡旁邊 
 This empowers the women to treasure their cultural heritage and take ownership of it. ||| 咁樣令到當地女性學識珍惜文化遺產 同埋對遺產負起主人翁嘅責任 
 I had the opportunity to spend some time with 24 of these women at a well-known archaeological site called Pachacamac, just outside Lima. ||| 我有機會同當地 24 名女性 就喺利馬以外嘅 著名考古遺跡 Pachacamac 
 Peru is just the beginning. ||| 秘魯只係開始 
 We're going to be expanding this platform to the world, but already I've gotten thousands of emails from people all across the world — professors, educators, students, and other archaeologists — who are so excited to help participate. ||| 我哋打算將呢個平台推廣到全世界 但目前我已經收到世界各地幾千封電郵 嚟自教授、教育工作者、學生 仲有考古學家 
 It's going to be launched formally by the end of the year. ||| 個平台將會喺今年年底正式發佈 
 Make sure to hold on to your alpacas. ||| 請繼續支持我哋呢個項目 
 Thank you very much. ||| 好多謝你哋 
 (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) ||| （掌聲） 多謝 （掌聲） 
 I thought I'd tell you a little about what I like to write. ||| 我想同大家講一啲關於我喜歡寫作嘅題材。 
 And I like to immerse myself in my topics. ||| 我都喜歡完全投入咁地研究我嘅題目。 
 I just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig. ||| 我奮不顧身咁投入去仲變成白老鼠。 
 And I see my life as a series of experiments. ||| 我當自己嘅人生係一連串嘅實驗。 
 "So, I work for Esquire magazine, and a couple of years ago, I wrote an article called ""My Outsourced Life,"" where I hired a team of people in Bangalore, India, to live my life for me." ||| "係咁嘅，先幾年我幫Esquire 雜誌社打工, 我曾經寫過一篇文章名叫做""我嘅外判生活"" 我係印度嘅Bangalore僱用咗一隊人 嚟替我生活。" 
 So, they answered my emails. ||| 所以佢地替我回覆電郵。 
 They answered my phone. ||| 佢地替我聽電話。 
 They argued with my wife for me, and they read my son bedtime stories. ||| 佢地幫我同老婆鬧交，幫我講故仔比個仔聽。 
 It was the best month of my life, because I just sat back and I read books and watched movies. ||| 依個係我人生中最美好嘅一個月。 因為我只須要好悠閒咁坐底睇書同睇電影。 
 It was a wonderful experience. ||| 係一個美好嘅體驗。 
 More recently, I wrote an article for Esquire called — about radical honesty. ||| 最近我幫Esquire 雜誌寫咗一篇文章叫做— 有關徹底的誠實。 
 And this is a movement where — this is started by a psychologist in Virginia, who says that you should never, ever lie, except maybe during poker and golf, his only exceptions. ||| 依個係一場行動— 由一個在維珍尼亞州嘅心理學家所開始嘅。 佢話人永遠永遠唔可以講大話。 除咗玩卑牌同打高爾夫球例外。 
 And, more than that, whatever is on your brain should come out of your mouth. ||| 除此之外，當你個腦諗到任何嘢 應該大聲講出來。 
 So, I decided I would try this for a month. ||| 我決定嘗試參加一個月。 
 This was the worst month of my life. ||| 依個係我人生中最差嘅一個月。 
 (Laughter) I do not recommend this at all. ||| （笑聲） 我完全唔建議大家去試。 
 "To give you a sense of the experience, the article was called, ""I Think You're Fat."" (Laughter) So, that was hard." ||| 我咁講你就會明白， 依編文章叫＂我覺得你好肥＂。 （笑聲） 所以係好困難嘅。 
 "My most recent book — my previous book was called ""The Know-It-All,"" and it was about the year I spent reading the Encyclopedia Britannica from A to Z in my quest to learn everything in the world, or more precisely from Aak, which is a type of East Asian music, all the way to Zwyiec, which is — well, I don't want to ruin the ending." ||| "我最近出咗一本書叫""全部都知道"" 書中講述我用咗一年時間去睇大英百科全書 由A至Z去讀，為咗知道世界上所有嘅事。 仔細來講係從A-ak(一種東亞音樂)開始， 一路到Zwyiec,係一種...我唔想搞壞演講嘅結尾。" 
 (Laughter) It's a very exciting twist ending, like an O. Henry novel, so I won't ruin it. ||| （笑聲） 這是一個令人興奮嘅結尾，好似一本O.Henry嘅小說，所以我唔想搞壞佢。 
 But I love that one, because that was an experiment about how much information one human brain could absorb. ||| 不過我好喜歡依種想法 因為依個實驗係研究到底人的腦袋 能容納多少資訊。 
 Although, listening to Kevin Kelly, you don't have to remember anything. ||| 雖然，根據Kevin Kelly 所講，做人唔駛記咁多嘢。 
 You can just Google it. ||| 你用Google就可以啦。 
 So, I wasted some time there. ||| 所以我係果度因浪費咗一啲時間。 
 "I love those experiments, but I think that the most profound and life-changing experiment that I've done is my most recent experiment, where I spent a year trying to follow all of the rules of the Bible, "The Year of Living Biblically."" ||| 我鐘意個果啲實驗。 但我認為我做過嘅實驗當中最有意義， 最能改變我一生嘅， 就係我最近完成嘅實驗。我用咗一年時間， 去嘗試遵守聖經上的所有規條。 生活在聖經中的一年 
 And I undertook this for two reasons. ||| 我做依個實驗係有兩個原因: 
 The first was that I grew up with no religion at all. ||| 第一係因為係我成長過程中一直冇接觸任何宗教. 
 As I say in my book, I'm Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian. ||| 正如我書中所講，話我係猶太人 就好似Olive Garden被當成義大利餐廳一樣 
 (Laughter) So, not very. ||| （笑聲） 因此，當然唔係咁樣。 
 But I've become increasingly interested in religion. ||| 但我對宗教愈來愈有興趣， 
 I do think it's the defining issue of our time, or one of the main ones. ||| 我覺得依個係這現世代裏具有決定性嘅話題。 又或者係具中一個重要嘅話題。 
 And I have a son. I want to know what to teach him. ||| 同時，我有一個仔。我想知道要點樣教佢。 
 So, I decided to dive in head first, and try to live the Bible. ||| 所以，我唔理三七二十一就開始按照聖經來生活。 
 The second reason I undertook this is because I'm concerned about the rise of fundamentalism, religious fundamentalism, and people who say they take the Bible literally, which is, according to some polls, as high as 45 or 50 percent of America. ||| 第二個令我咁樣做嘅原因係因為 我十分關注原教旨主義嘅興起, 宗教上嘅原教旨主義，很多人聲稱 佢地完全依照聖經生活，根據訪問，竟然 佔了美國人口的45到50%. 
 So I decided, what if you really did take the Bible literally? ||| 所以我決定睇吓，如果你係按照聖經字面上的意思過活嘅話，會發生什麼事？ 
 I decided to take it to its logical conclusion and take everything in the Bible literally, without picking and choosing. ||| 我決定要遵守佢同佢邏輯上嘅推論, 按照聖經字面上所有指示, 不去揀擇。 
 The first thing I did was I got a stack of bibles. ||| 我做的第一件事就係搵一疊聖經。 
 I had Christian bibles. ||| 我有基督教嘅聖經。 
 I had Jewish bibles. ||| 我有猶太教嘅聖經。 
 "A friend of mine sent me something called a hip-hop bible, where the twenty-third Psalm is rendered as, ""The Lord is all that,"" as opposed to what I knew it as, ""The Lord is my shepherd."" Then I went down and I read several versions, and I wrote down every single law that I could find." ||| "我有朋友寄咗一本叫＂a hip-hop bibile""嘅書比我。 其中詩篇第二十三節變改為，＂主是所有事情。＂ 相對我知道嘅＂主是我的牧人。＂節然不同。 我繼續讀咗幾個版本。 並寫低我找到的嘅有規條。" 
 And this was a very long list — over 700 rules. ||| 係一個好長嘅清單，多過七百條規則。 
 And they range from the famous ones that I had heard of — The Ten Commandments, love your neighbor, be fruitful and multiply. ||| "並且包含一啲有名嘅律法同一啲我曾經聽過嘅— ""十戒""、""愛你的鄰人""、""多結果子和生養眾多""。" 
 So I wanted to follow those. ||| 因此我要遵守依啲規條。 
 And actually, I take my projects very seriously, because I had twins during my year, so I definitely take my projects seriously. ||| 我好認真咁執行依個計劃。 因為果年我生咗雙胞胎， 所以我確實認真的執行這計劃。 
 But I also wanted to follow the hundreds of arcane and obscure laws that are in the Bible. ||| 但係我都想遵守其他數百條 係聖經裏令人費解同模糊嘅規則 
 "There is the law in Leviticus, "You cannot shave the corners of your beard."" ||| 係利未記中有一條規條， 你唔可以剃去你鬍鬚嘅角位。 
 I didn't know where my corners were, so I decided to let the whole thing grow, and this is what I looked like by the end. ||| 我都唔知道邊度係我啲鬍鬚嘅角位， 所以我決定留鬍鬚, 依張係我最後嘅樣。 
 As you can imagine, I spent a lot of time at airport security. ||| 你可以想像到，我係機場保安關卡用咗好多時間。 
 (Laughter) My wife wouldn't kiss me for the last two months. ||| （笑聲） 我老婆係最後兩個月裏唔肯錫我。 
 So, certainly the challenge was there. ||| 亳無疑問，難度就一定有嘅。 
 "The Bible says you cannot wear clothes made of mixed fibers, so I thought, ""Sounds strange, but I'll try it."" You only know if you try it." ||| 聖經裡面話你唔可以不著混合纖維嘅衫， 所以我諗，＂聽落好奇怪，但我都會試吓。＂ 你要試過先會明白. 
 I got rid of all my poly-cotton T-shirts. ||| 我丟晒所有半尼龍半綿嘅T恤 
 The Bible says that if two men are in a fight, and the wife of one of those men grabs the testicles of the other man, then her hand shall be cut off. ||| 聖經話如果有兩個男人打架， 如果其中一方嘅老婆抓住另一個男人嘅睪丸， 佢隻手將會被砍。 
 So, I wanted to follow that rule. ||| 所以，我想遵守依條規則。 
 (Laughter) That one I followed by default, by not getting in a fight with a man whose wife was standing nearby, looking like she had a strong grip. (Laughter) ||| （笑聲） 我用咗一 個方法去遵守依條規則— 就係唔好同一個有老婆企係隔離嘅男人打架 而且佢隻手睇起來好很有抓勁。 （笑聲） 
 So — oh, there's another shot of my beard. ||| 所以—奧，依張相係影我啲鬍鬚嘅 
 I will say it was an amazing year because it really was life changing, and incredibly challenging. ||| 我覺得係出人意表嘅一年 因為佢真係改變咗我嘅一生仲好有挑戰性添。 
 And there were two types of laws that were particularly challenging. ||| 有兩種規條特別困難。 
 The first was avoiding the little sins that we all commit every day. ||| 第一係避免一啲我地平日皆犯嘅小錯 
 You know, I could spend a year not killing, but spending a year not gossiping, not coveting, not lying — you know, I live in New York, and I work as a journalist, so this was 75, 80 percent of my day I had to do it. ||| 你知道，我可以一年都唔殺生， 但係一年內不講人壞話，唔偷睇，不講大話— 要知道，我住喺紐約市，我嘅工作喺記者， 所以我每日嘅生活有75至80%都要做依啲嘢 
 But it was really interesting, because I was able to make some progress, because I couldn't believe how much my behavior changed my thoughts. ||| 但喺都幾有趣，因為我得到一啲進步， 由於我唔相信 我嘅行為可以改變多少我的思想。 
 This was one of the huge lessons of the year, is that I almost pretended to be a better person, and I became a little bit of a better person. ||| 依樣喺我依一年內學到最寶貴嘅一課之一, 我幾乎扮成一個好人， 我變得好人了一點點。 
 "So I had always thought, you know, ""You change your mind, and you change your behavior,"" but it's often the other way around." ||| "我以前曾經咁諗，""你改變你嘅思想， 然後行為先至會改變"",但其實經常相反。" 
 You change your behavior, and you change your mind. ||| 你改變你嘅行為，然後你改變你的嘅思想。 
 So, you know, if you want to become more compassionate, you visit sick people in the hospital, and you will become more compassionate. ||| 所以，你知道嘅,如果你想變得更有同情心， 你去醫院探訪病人嘅話， 然後你就會變得富有同情心。 
 You donate money to a cause, and you become emotionally involved in that cause. ||| 你為某件事捐款， 然後你就放感情晌果度. 
 So, it really was cognitive psychology — you know, cognitive dissonance — that I was experiencing. ||| 所以，依啲其實喺認知心理學— 你知道，認知失調 — 我正在經歷。 
 The Bible actually talks about cognitive psychology, very primitive cognitive psychology. ||| 聖經嘅內容實際上喺是關於認知心理學, 最基礎嘅認知心理學。 
 In the Proverbs, it says that if you smile, you will become happier, which, as we know, is actually true. ||| 喺箴言裡面講述，如果你笑的話，你會變得快樂， 人人都知，喺真實嘅。 
 The second type of rule that was difficult to obey was the rules that will get you into a little trouble in twenty-first-century America. ||| 第二種困難去遵守的規則喺， 果啲規則會為我們帶來小麻煩 在21世紀嘅美國。 
 And perhaps the clearest example of this is stoning adulterers. ||| 可能最清晰嘅例子喺是向通姦嘅人丟石頭。 
 (Laughter) But it's a big part of the Bible, so I figured I had to address it. ||| （笑聲） 但喺依樣喺聖經裏面好大嘅一部分。 所以我想我一定要回應依個問題。 
 So, I was able to stone one adulterer. ||| 所以,我真喺囉石頭丟一個通姦者。 
 It happened — I was in the park, and I was dressed in my biblical clothing, so sandals and sort of a white robe, you know, because again, the outer affects the inner. ||| 件事喺咁發生嘅—我當時喺公園裏頭，著住一身聖經式嘅裝扮— 涼鞋同白色的大袍— 你知道，頭先講過因為外在會影響內在嘅情況下, 
 I wanted to see how dressing biblically affected my mind. ||| 我想知道依一身聖經嘅衣著可以點樣改變我嘅思想。 
 "And this man came up to me and he said, "Why are you dressed like that?"" ||| 然後個男人走過來同我講， ＂點解你要著成咁樣？＂ 
 "And I explained my project, and he said, ""Well, I am an adulterer, are you going to stone me?"" And I said, ""Well, that would be great!"" (Laughter) And I actually took out a handful of stones from my pocket that I had been carrying around for weeks, hoping for just this interaction — and, you know, they were pebbles — but he grabbed them out of my hand." ||| 然後我向佢解釋我嘅的計劃， 然後佢話，＂我喺一個姦夫，咁你會用石頭丟我嗎？＂ 然後我話，＂好!這當然最好不過啦!＂ （笑聲） 於是我喺我個袋裡面囉咗幾舊石頭， 我已經隨身攜帶咗了好幾星期， 希望一有機會就—當然，果啲喺細石頭— 但係個男人搶咗我手上嘅石頭。 
 He was actually an elderly man, mid-70s, just so you know. ||| 佢其實係一個七十多歲嘅老人家， 
 But he's still an adulterer, and still quite angry. ||| 不過佢仍然係一個姦夫，而且係好嬲果種， 
 He grabbed them out of my hand and threw them at my face, and I felt that I could — eye for an eye — I could retaliate, and throw one back at him. ||| 他搶去了我的石塊。 然後投擲在我的臉中，當時我覺得我可以－ 以眼還眼，我可以報復，所以投擲一塊於他身上。 
 So that was my experience stoning, and it did allow me to talk about, in a more serious way, these big issues. ||| 所以，這是我投石的經驗，這容許我 去用較嚴肅的方法去談及這些重要的課題， 
 How can the Bible be so barbaric in some places, and yet so incredibly wise in others? ||| 為什麼聖經在某方面能這樣的蠻不講理， 但又在某些地方充滿智慧 
 How should we view the Bible? ||| 我們應該怎樣看待聖經？ 
 Should we view it, you know, as original intent, like a sort of a Scalia version of the Bible? ||| 我們應該是從原意出發， 像是一種Scalia(美國大法官)式的聖經？ 
 How was the Bible written? ||| 聖經是怎樣寫成的？ 
 And actually, since this is a tech crowd, I talk in the book about how the Bible actually reminds me of the Wikipedia, because it has all of these authors and editors over hundreds of years. ||| 但其實，由於這是一個科技的集會， 我書中曾提到聖經其實令我想起了 維基百科，因為它是由各種各樣的作者和編輯編成 在這幾百年裏。 
 And it's sort of evolved. ||| 它還某程度上進化了。 
 It's not a book that was written and came down from on high. ||| 它並不是一本隨天上掉下來的書。 
 So I thought I would end by telling you just a couple of the take-aways, the bigger lessons that I learned from my year. ||| 所以我想我最後會告訴你， 是一些易於記住的重要道理， 我在這一年學到的。 
 The first is, thou shalt not take the Bible literally. ||| 第一，你不應該硬性地跟隨字面上去理解聖經的意思。 
 This became very, very clear, early on. ||| 這很早就已經顯然易見。 
 Because if you do, then you end up acting like a crazy person, and stoning adulterers, or — here's another example. ||| 因為你這樣的話，你會變成一個瘋漢， 投石於姦夫，又或是，再多舉一個例子， 
 Well, that's another. I did spend some time shepherding. ||| 好的,這是另一個—我真的用了一點時間去牧羊。 
 (Laughter) It's a very relaxing vocation. I recommend it. ||| （笑聲） 這是一個很輕鬆的職業。我大力推介。 
 But this one is — the Bible says that you cannot touch women during certain times of the month, and more than that, you cannot sit on a seat where a menstruating woman has sat. ||| 但這條規則－聖經說你不能觸碰女人， 於每個月的某些日子，還有, 你不能坐在曾經被經期婦女坐過的椅子。 
 And my wife thought this was very offensive, so she sat in every seat in our apartment, and I had to spend much of the year standing until I bought my own seat and carried it around. ||| 我的妻子覺得這很侮辱女人, 所以她把我們家的每個座位都坐了一遍。 我要在那一年中站了不少時間。 直至我買給自己可以隨身攜帶的椅子。 
 So, you know, I met with creationists. ||| 所以,你知道的,我遇到一個創世論者. 
 I went to the creationists' museum. ||| 我去了他們的博物館， 
 And these are the ultimate literalists. ||| 他們是終極的字面跟隨者， 
 And it was fascinating, because they were not stupid people at all. ||| 這真令人眼界大開，因為他們根本不是蠢人來的。 
 I would wager that their IQ is exactly the same as the average evolutionist. ||| 我賭他們的智商跟相信進化論的人一樣。 
 It's just that their faith is so strong in this literal interpretation of the Bible that they distort all the data to fit their model. ||| 只是他們有很強烈的信仰， 執著於聖經上的字面解釋 他們扭曲所有的數據以滿足他們的模式。 
 And they go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this. ||| 他們通過這些令人驚訝的心理訓練來做到這一點。 
 And I will say, though, the museum is gorgeous. ||| 然而我要說的是,這博物館很華麗。 
 They really did a fantastic job. ||| 他們真的做得很好。 
 If you're ever in Kentucky, there's, you can see a movie of the flood, and they have sprinklers in the ceiling that will sprinkle on you during the flood scenes. ||| 如果你到過肯塔基州, 就是這—你可以去看關於大洪水的電影, 他們在天花板上裝灑水器 當播放到洪水畫面時便淋水在你身上. 
 So, whatever you think of creationism — and I think it's crazy — they did a great job. ||| 所以,不管你怎樣看待創世論者,我覺得他們很荒誕, 他們做得很好。 
 (Laughter) Another lesson is that thou shalt give thanks. ||| （笑聲） 另一個道理是該感恩。 
 And this one was a big lesson because I was praying, giving these prayers of thanksgiving, which was odd for an agnostic. ||| 這是重要的一課因為我在禱告時， 我在感恩禱告，這是一件對於無神論者而言很怪的事情。 
 But I was saying thanks all the time, every day, and I started to change my perspective. ||| 但我每天常常都在感恩,任何時間, 我開始改變了自己看事情的角度， 
 And I started to realize the hundreds of little things that go right every day, that I didn't even notice, that I took for granted, as opposed to focusing on the three or four that went wrong. ||| 而且我開始了解身邊數以百計的小事情， 那些如意的事情，那些小得我不會發覺的事。 我把他們的發生當作理所當然的—但不是把視線集中於 少數不如意的事情。 
 So, this is actually a key to happiness for me, is to just remember when I came over here, the car didn't flip over, and I didn't trip coming up the stairs. ||| 所以，這是我快樂的秘訣， 只是去記得我來會場的途中， 車子沒有翻掉，我沒有在上樓梯時滑倒， 
 It's a remarkable thing. ||| 這是一件精彩的事。 
 Third, that thou shall have reverence. ||| 第三，你要尊敬別人， 
 This one was unexpected because I started the year as an agnostic, and by the end of the year, I became what a friend of mine calls a reverent agnostic, which I love. ||| 這個是出人意表的因為我這年開始的時候， 是一個不可知論者，到了年末， 我變成一個給朋友叫作尊敬的不可知論者,我十分喜愛這個名稱。 
 And I'm trying to start it as a movement. ||| 我現在嘗試將這個活動變為潮流. 
 So, if anyone wants to join, the basic idea is, whether or not there is a God, there's something important and beautiful about the idea of sacredness, and that our rituals can be sacred. ||| 所以如果大家想參加的話， 最基本的概念是，無論有沒有神的存在， 總有一些重要和美麗的神聖的想法, 而且我們的儀式是很神聖的。 
 The Sabbath can be sacred. ||| 安息日是很神聖的。 
 This was one of the great things about my year, doing the Sabbath, because I am a workaholic, so having this one day where you cannot work, it really, that changed my life. ||| 我這年其中一樣美好的事，就是守安息日, 因為我是個工作狂，當我有了這樣的一天， 當不能工作—真的大大改變了我一生。 
 So, this idea of sacredness, whether or not there is a God. ||| 所以,這是神聖的概念，無論有沒有上帝也好. 
 Thou shall not stereotype. ||| 你都不應把它公式化。 
 This one happened because I spent a lot of time with various religious communities throughout America because I wanted it to be more than about my journey. ||| 這種體會是因為我 用了很多時間跟隨了不同的宗教團體， 在美國各地。因為我想它 不只是我個人的旅程。 
 I wanted it to be about religion in America. ||| 我想探討美國的宗教， 
 So, I spent time with evangelical Christians, and Hasidic Jews, and the Amish. ||| 因此我用了不少時間在福音派基督教、哈西德教派和阿米希教派。 
 I'm very proud because I think I'm the only person in America to out Bible-talk a Jehovah's Witness. ||| 我感到自豪因為 我覺得我是美國唯一一個 能在宗教討論時說服到一個耶和華見證。 
 "(Laughter) After three and a half hours, he looked at his watch, he's like, ""I gotta go."" (Laughter) Oh, thank you very much." ||| （笑聲） 在三個半小時後，他看一看他的手表， 他說，＂我不得不走了。＂ （笑聲） 謝謝大家。 
 Thank you. Bless you, bless you. ||| 謝謝。祝福你，祝福你。 
 But it was interesting because I had some very preconceived notions about, for instance, evangelical Christianity, and I found that it's such a wide and varied movement that it is difficult to make generalizations about it. ||| 但這是很有趣的， 因為我有一些先入為主的思想，例如， 福音派基督教，我發現， 這次一個很廣泛的運動， 是很難一概而論的。 
 There's a group I met with called the Red Letter Christians, and they focus on the red words in the Bible, which are the ones that Jesus spoke. ||| 我認識一隊人叫紅字基督徒， 他們集中研究在聖經裏的紅字， 那些是耶穌所說的話— 
 That's how they printed them in the old Bibles. ||| 在舊聖經中都是以紅色印上去的。 
 And their argument is that Jesus never talked about homosexuality. ||| 他們的論點是耶穌從來沒有講過同性戀。 
 "They have a pamphlet that says, "Here's what Jesus said about homosexuality," and you open it up, and there's nothing in it." ||| 他們有一本小冊子說著, 這是耶穌曾就同性戀所說的話, 然而你把它打開,發覺當中空白一片。 
 So, they say Jesus did talk a lot about helping the outcasts, helping poor people. ||| 所以，他們說耶穌曾說過很多有關幫助被抛棄的人的事， 幫助窮人的事。 
 So, this was very inspiring to me. ||| 所以這對我有很大的啟發。 
 I recommend Jim Wallis and Tony Campolo. ||| 我會推介Jim Wallace 和Tony Campolo, 
 They're very inspiring leaders, even though I disagree with much of what they say. ||| 他們是非常鼓舞人心的領袖,縱使我不認同, 他們多數的言論。 
 Also, thou shalt not disregard the irrational. ||| 還有,你不可以忽略不理性的事情. 
 This one was very unexpected because, you know, I grew up with the scientific worldview, and I was shocked learning how much of my life is governed by irrational forces. ||| 這個發現令我驚訝非常,因為,你們知道, 我從科學化的角度中成長, 然而我十分震驚的發現我的生命 是由非理性的力量所操控. 
 And the thing is, if they're not harmful, they're not to be completely dismissed. ||| 還有的是,就算那些力量不是有害的, 他們不可以完全去除的。 
 "Because I learned that — I was thinking, I was doing all these rituals, these biblical rituals, separating my wool and linen, and I would ask these religious people "Why would the Bible possibly tell us to do this? Why would God care?"" ||| 因為我學會了，當我在想－ 我做了這些儀式，這些聖經上的儀式， 區分羊毛和麻布質料。 我問那些虔誠的人， ＂為什麼聖經要我們做這些東西？為什麼上帝會注意這些事情？＂ 
 "And they said, ""We don't know, but it's just rituals that give us meaning."" And I would say, ""But that's crazy."" And they would say, ""Well, what about you?" ||| 他們會回答，＂我們不知道, 但這些儀式給與我們某些特定意義。＂ 我會說，＂這是不可理喻的。＂ 他們回答，＂那麼你又怎樣？＂ 
 You blow out candles on top of a birthday cake. ||| 你吹熄了生日蛋糕上的蠟燭 
 "If a guy from Mars came down and saw, here's one guy blowing out the fire on top of a cake versus another guy not wearing clothes of mixed fabrics, would the Martians say, 'Well, that guy, he makes sense, but that guy's crazy?'"" So no, I think that rituals are, by nature, irrational." ||| 如果火星來的人看見,他會說 有一個人正在吹熄了生日蛋糕上的火光。 對比於一個不穿混合纖維衣服的人， 火星人會不會說，＂這個人很正常，＂ ＂但那個人是變態的嗎？＂ 不是，所以我覺得那些儀式在自然層面來說，是不理性的。 
 So the key is to choose the right rituals, the ones that are not harmful — but rituals by themselves are not to be dismissed. ||| 所以重點是要挑選正確的儀式， 那些無害的儀式—但是儀式本身 他們不會給忽略的。 
 And finally I learned that thou shall pick and choose. ||| 最後，我學到了大家應該有所選擇。 
 And this one I learned because I tried to follow everything in the Bible. ||| 我學了這個因為 我嘗是跟迶聖經中的所有的事， 
 And I failed miserably. ||| 但我淒慘地失敗。 
 Because you can't. ||| 因為你不可以， 
 You have to pick and choose. And anyone who follows the Bible is going to be picking and choosing. ||| 所以你要挑選，任何人要遵守聖經的話， 也要挑選。 
 The key is to pick and choose the right parts. ||| 重點在於挑選正確的部分。 
 "There's the phrase called cafeteria religion, and the fundamentalists will use it in a denigrating way, and they'll say, ""Oh, it's just cafeteria religion." ||| "有一個詞彙叫做""自助餐式宗教"" 基本主義的人會把它視為有詆毀性般去使用。 他們會說，＂這只是自坐助餐式宗教。＂" 
 "You're just picking and choosing."" But my argument is, ""What's wrong with cafeterias?"" I've had some great meals at cafeterias." ||| 你只是在挑你喜歡的東西。 但我的論點是，＂自助餐又有什麼問題呢？＂ 我在自助餐廳有吃得很開心的經驗。 
 I've also had some meals that make me want to dry heave. ||| 亦曾遇到一些難吃得令人噴飯的 
 So, it's about choosing the parts of the Bible about compassion, about tolerance, about loving your neighbor, as opposed to the parts about homosexuality is a sin, or intolerance, or violence, which are very much in the Bible as well. ||| 所以，這是關於怎樣挑選聖經裡有關同情心的部分， 有關包容，有關愛你的近鄰， 跟反對＂同性戀等於罪＂ 又或是不寬容，或暴力, 在聖經裡也相當的多。 
 So if we are to find any meaning in this book, then we have to really engage it, and wrestle with it. ||| 所以我們要在這本書找出任何意義， 我們必須全身投入，並且奮戰不懈。 
 And I thought I'd end with just a couple more. ||| 我想臨走前多給大家幾個例子。 
 There's me reading the Bible. ||| 這是我正在閱讀聖經. 
 That's how I hailed taxicabs. ||| 這是我如何招呼的士。 
 (Laughter) Seriously, and it worked. And yes, that was actually a rented sheep, so I had to return that in the morning, but it served well for a day. ||| （笑聲） 認真的，而且有效的—且是的, 那其實是一只租來的羊, 所以我必須在早上歸還牠,但是牠整天都被好好的照顧。 
 So, anyway, thank you so much for letting me speak. ||| 所以,無論如何,謝謝你們讓我來演講。 
 I'm going to be talking to you about how we can tap a really underutilized resource in health care, which is the patient, or, as I like to use the scientific term, people. ||| 我將會同大家講吓 我哋點樣可以有效利用 一種絕對被忽視嘅醫療上嘅資源。 呢種資源就係病人本身， 或者﹐以科學術語嚟講 —— 人。 
 Because we are all patients, we are all people. ||| 因為我哋都係病人，我們亦都係人。 
 Even doctors are patients at some point. ||| 就連醫生﹐有時都可以係病人。 
 So I want to talk about that as an opportunity that we really have failed to engage with very well in this country and, in fact, worldwide. ||| 所以我想討論呢種資源 可帶嚟嘅良機﹐ 一項我哋國家﹐甚至全世界 都冇足夠善用到嘅良機。 
 If you want to get at the big part — I mean from a public health level, where my training is — you're looking at behavioral issues. ||| 如果你想由大局嚟睇 — 由公共醫療嘅角度﹐即係我嘅職業範圍 — 我哋就見到行為上嘅問題， 
 You're looking at things where people are actually given information, and they're not following through with it. ||| 你會發現人得到訊息之後﹐ 並冇妥善跟進。 
 It's a problem that manifests itself in diabetes, obesity, many forms of heart disease, even some forms of cancer — when you think of smoking. ||| 呢個問題﹐於糖尿病﹑ 肥胖症以及多種嘅心臟病﹐ 甚至﹐如果考慮到吸煙問題﹐於癌症方面﹐都有存在。 
 Those are all behaviors where people know what they're supposed to do. ||| 所有人都知道應該要點樣做先至正確﹐ 
 They know what they're supposed to be doing, but they're not doing it. ||| 雖然知道應該要點樣做﹐ 但佢哋冇去做到。 
 Now behavior change is something that is a long-standing problem in medicine. ||| 要將行為改變﹐ 一直都係醫學上長期存在嘅問題。 
 It goes all the way back to Aristotle. ||| 遠至亞里士多德嘅時代都有存在。 
 And doctors hate it, right? ||| 而且醫生都討厭呢種行為，係嗎？ 
 I mean, they complain about it all the time. ||| 我意思係﹐醫生經常都抱怨呢個問題。 
 We talk about it in terms of engagement, or non-compliance. ||| 我哋通常歸納為留心聽取﹐以及唔聽指示。 
 When people don't take their pills, when people don't follow doctors' orders — these are behavior problems. ||| 當有人唔食藥﹑ 唔聽醫生吩咐﹐ 呢啲都係行為問題。 
 But for as much as clinical medicine agonizes over behavior change, there's not a lot of work done in terms of trying to fix that problem. ||| 但係無論臨床醫學專家點樣 為改變病人行為嘅問題而煩惱﹐ 要解決呢個問題﹐ 我哋能力根本有限。 
 So the crux of it comes down to this notion of decision-making — giving information to people in a form that doesn't just educate them or inform them, but actually leads them to make better decisions, better choices in their lives. ||| 因此解決問題嘅關鍵 在於助人去作出正確嘅判斷 — 即是於提供信息嘅時候﹐ 不單只教育病人﹐ 或者通知佢哋， 而係實際上引導佢哋去作更好嘅決定﹐ 於生活上作更好嘅選擇。 
 One part of medicine, though, has faced the problem of behavior change pretty well, and that's dentistry. ||| 其實﹐喺醫學上有一個領域 已經比較成功解決到行為改變方面嘅問題﹐ 就係牙科。 
 Dentistry might seem — and I think it is — many dentists would have to acknowledge it's somewhat of a mundane backwater of medicine. ||| 好多人眼中﹐包括我自己﹐ 而且好多牙醫都承認， 牙科於某程度係醫學上一個沉悶嘅死角。 
 Not a lot of cool, sexy stuff happening in dentistry. ||| 牙科嘅領域一般都冇任何新奇有趣嘅事發生。 
 But they have really taken this problem of behavior change and solved it. ||| 但係佢哋確實有將改變行為嘅問題作出研究 而且解決咗呢個問題。 
 It's the one great preventive health success we have in our health care system. ||| 呢個係我哋嘅醫療保體系統中 一個非常成功嘅疾病預防嘅例子。 
 People brush and floss their teeth. ||| 每個人都刷牙﹐而且用牙線剔牙。 
 They don't do it as much as they should, but they do it. ||| 佢哋雖然做得唔夠多﹐但係都總算有做。 
 So I'm going to talk about one experiment that a few dentists in Connecticut cooked up about 30 years ago. ||| 所以我就想同大家分享一個實驗。 呢個係一個30年前﹐幾個喺美國康州嘅牙醫 諗出嚟嘅實驗。 
 So this is an old experiment, but it's a really good one, because it was very simple, so it's an easy story to tell. ||| 呢個實驗雖然古老，但係的確唔錯 因為佢非常簡單， 所以亦好容易說明。 
 So these Connecticut dentists decided that they wanted to get people to brush their teeth and floss their teeth more often, and they were going to use one variable: they wanted to scare them. ||| 話說﹐呢班康州嘅牙醫決定 想令到病人更頻密地刷牙﹐而且用牙線清理牙齒。 而佢哋利用咗一個變量﹕ 佢哋想要令人驚怕。 
 They wanted to tell them how bad it would be if they didn't brush and floss their teeth. ||| 佢哋想講給病人知道 如果唔刷牙﹑唔用牙線﹐後果將會點樣嚴重。 
 They had a big patient population. ||| 佢哋當時有好多病人。 
 They divided them up into two groups. ||| 於是將呢些病人分成兩組。 
 They had a low-fear population, where they basically gave them a 13-minute presentation, all based in science, but told them that, if you didn't brush and floss your teeth, you could get gum disease. If you get gum disease, you will lose your teeth, but you'll get dentures, and it won't be that bad. ||| 一組是低恐慌組， 佢哋比呢組人睇一段13分鐘 有科學根據嘅講解， 但係亦講比佢哋知道，如果唔刷牙﹑唔用牙線， 可能就會得到牙周病，而如果得到牙周病，就會失去牙齒， 但係重可以戴假牙，情況就唔會太差。 
 So that was the low-fear group. ||| 呢個就是低恐慌組嘅部份。 
 The high-fear group, they laid it on really thick. ||| 對於高恐慌組﹐佢哋就落足料。 
 They showed bloody gums. ||| 佢哋比呢一組睇見血淋淋嘅牙肉﹑ 
 They showed puss oozing out from between their teeth. ||| 牙縫之間流膿嘅口腔。 
 They told them that their teeth were going to fall out. ||| 佢哋對實驗者講牙齒會脫落﹑ 
 They said that they could have infections that would spread from their jaws to other parts of their bodies, and ultimately, yes, they would lose their teeth. ||| 佢哋會受到細菌感染 而細菌會由嘴巴擴散到身體其他部份， 同埋最後﹐佢哋當然會失去牙齒。 
 They would get dentures, and if you got dentures, you weren't going to be able to eat corn-on-the-cob, you weren't going to be able to eat apples, you weren't going to be able to eat steak. ||| 雖然都可以戴假牙，但是戴假牙 就再唔可以食原條粟米﹑ 唔可以食蘋果﹑ 唔可以食牛扒。 
 You'll eat mush for the rest of your life. ||| 下半世就只好食糊狀嘅食物。 
 So go brush and floss your teeth. ||| 所以快去刷牙同埋用牙線啦。 
 That was the message. That was the experiment. ||| 呢個就係其中嘅信息，實驗就係咁樣進行。 
 Now they measured one other variable. ||| 跟住佢哋測試咗另一個變量。 
 They wanted to capture one other variable, which was the patients' sense of efficacy. ||| 佢哋想要研究嘅變量就係 病人自認為嘅能動性。 
 This was the notion of whether the patients felt that they actually would go ahead and brush and floss their teeth. ||| 即係話﹐病人自己認為佢哋會唔會 真係去刷牙同埋用牙線。 
 "So they asked them at the beginning, "Do you think you'll actually be able to stick with this program?"" ||| 所以於實驗嘅開始﹐佢哋問病人﹐ 「你哋認為自己的確會依照呢個計劃進行嗎？」 
 "And the people who said, ""Yeah, yeah. I'm pretty good about that,"" they were characterized as high efficacy, and the people who said, "Eh, I never get around to brushing and flossing as much as I should," they were characterized as low efficacy." ||| 回答「會﹑一定會﹐呢方面我好在行」嘅參加者﹐ 都被列入高能動性嘅一組。 而回答「噢﹐我從來都無法養成 刷牙﹑用牙線嘅習慣」嘅人﹐ 都被列入缺乏能動性嘅一組。 
 So the upshot was this. ||| 終於得到嘅結論就係咁樣。 
 The upshot of this experiment was that fear was not really a primary driver of the behavior at all. ||| 呢個實驗證實 恐懼其實完全唔係帶動行為的 主要因素。 
 The people who brushed and flossed their teeth were not necessarily the people who were really scared about what would happen — it's the people who simply felt that they had the capacity to change their behavior. ||| 照指示刷牙﹑用牙線嘅人 並唔一定係 對可能帶來嘅後果感到恐懼嘅人﹐ 而係只需要係認為自己有能力 去改變自己行為嘅人。 
 So fear showed up as not really the driver. ||| 因此顯示到﹐能夠改變行為嘅原動力並唔係恐懼， 
 It was the sense of efficacy. ||| 而係病人自認為嘅能動性。 
 So I want to isolate this, because it was a great observation — 30 years ago, right, 30 years ago — and it's one that's laid fallow in research. ||| 所以我想特別談及呢個例子， 因為呢個確實係非常唔錯嘅觀察結果， 30年前﹐冇錯﹐係30年前嘅結論﹐ 而一直冇被發揮﹑利用嘅﹐就係呢個結論。 
 It was a notion that really came out of Albert Bandura's work, who studied whether people could get a sense of empowerment. ||| 呢個想法其實起源於 Albert Bandura 嘅研究之中﹐ 佢曾研究 人是否可取得賦能感。 
 The notion of efficacy basically boils down to one — that if somebody believes that they have the capacity to change their behavior. ||| 能動性嘅理念最後可以總結為﹕ 一個人是否相信﹐自己有能力去改變自己嘅行為。 
 In health care terms, you could characterize this as whether or not somebody feels that they see a path towards better health, that they can actually see their way towards getting better health, and that's a very important notion. ||| 以醫療角度，我哋可以將呢個概括爲 人是否能夠意識到 佢哋改善健康狀況嘅途徑， 以至佢哋能夠確實為自己健康作出改善。 而呢個係非常重要嘅一個觀點。 
 It's an amazing notion. ||| 係一個奇妙嘅觀點。 
 We don't really know how to manipulate it, though, that well. ||| 只不過我哋未懂得點樣去有效利用佢。 
 Except, maybe we do. ||| 又或者﹐我哋已經懂得。 
 So fear doesn't work, right? Fear doesn't work. ||| 恐懼起唔到作用。係﹐恐懼起唔到作用。 
 And this is a great example of how we haven't learned that lesson at all. ||| 而呢個係個非常好嘅例子， 證明我哋完全唔會接受教訓。 
 This is a campaign from the American Diabetes Association. ||| 以下係美國糖尿病協會嘅一個宣傳活動。 
 This is still the way we're communicating messages about health. ||| 亦都係目前醫療健康方面仍然採用來傳達信息嘅方法。 
 "I mean, I showed my three-year-old this slide last night, and he's like, ""Papa, why is an ambulance in these people's homes?"" And I had to explain, ""They're trying to scare people."" And I don't know if it works." ||| 我想講嘅係，我昨晚比我三歲嘅孩子睇咗呢張幻燈片， 然後佢話：「爸爸，點解呢啲人屋企裡面會有救護車呢？」 我只能解釋：「呢個只係用來嚇人。」 我都唔知道呢個做法有效與否。 
 Now here's what does work: personalized information works. ||| 而以下才是有效嘅方法。 就係個人化嘅信息。 
 Again, Bandura recognized this years ago, decades ago. ||| 又是 Bandura﹐喺幾十年前 認出了呢一點。 
 When you give people specific information about their health, where they stand, and where they want to get to, where they might get to, that path, that notion of a path — that tends to work for behavior change. ||| 當您向他人提供具體嘅﹑ 關乎佢哋健康嘅﹑佢哋目前病情嘅信息﹐ 以及佢哋可以達到嘅狀況﹑可能會出現嘅情況嘅信息﹐ 就是呢條路途﹑呢條路途嘅理念﹐ 令到人嘅行為作出改變。 
 So let me just spool it out a little bit. ||| 請等我詳盡少少去解釋。 
 So you start with personalized data, personalized information that comes from an individual, and then you need to connect it to their lives. ||| 您可以由一個人身上得到嘅 個人化嘅數據﹑個人化嘅資料開始﹐ 然後將呢啲跟每個人的生活聯繫起來。 
 You need to connect it to their lives, hopefully not in a fear-based way, but one that they understand. ||| 您要將資訊跟佢哋嘅生活聯繫起來。 最好係以一種唔會令人感到恐懼嘅方式﹐而係一種佢哋可以理解嘅方式。 
 Okay, I know where I sit. I know where I'm situated. ||| 好喇﹐我已知道自己嘅立場。我已知道自己嘅位置。 
 And that doesn't just work for me in terms of abstract numbers — this overload of health information that we're inundated with. ||| 而用抽象嘅數目子作根基的話﹐對我毫無意義﹐ 呢啲過多嘅有關健康嘅資訊 實在氾濫得令我哋應付不來﹐ 
 But it actually hits home. ||| 但係佢哋其實係解決問題嘅根源。 
 It's not just hitting us in our heads; it's hitting us in our hearts. ||| 佢哋不單止影響我哋嘅思想﹐亦都帶動我哋嘅情緒。 
 There's an emotional connection to information because it's from us. ||| 我哋對呢啲信息有不解嘅情結， 因為呢啲信息起源自我哋本身。 
 That information then needs to be connected to choices, needs to be connected to a range of options, directions that we might go to — trade-offs, benefits. ||| 然後﹐呢啲資料需要與選擇串連起來， 需要與各種各樣嘅選摘連貫起來， 包括有可能嘅發生嘅情況 — 各種利弊。 
 Finally, we need to be presented with a clear point of action. ||| 最後，我哋需要被清楚地告知﹐要採取點樣嘅行動。 
 We need to connect the information always with the action, and then that action feeds back into different information, and it creates, of course, a feedback loop. ||| 我哋需要每次都將信息 跟行動串連起來﹐ 然後果個行動再反饋成 另一份信息 而當然，咁樣因此形成一個反饋循環。 
 Now this is a very well-observed and well-established notion for behavior change. ||| 其實呢一套理念﹐已經係一套相當有根據﹑廣泛被公認嘅﹑ 用作行為改變嘅理念。 
 But the problem is that things — in the upper-right corner there — personalized data, it's been pretty hard to come by. ||| 但問題係，圖中右上角嘅 個人數據﹐因為通常都係難以取得嘅。 
 It's a difficult and expensive commodity, until now. ||| 個人數據係一種難以得到嘅奢侈品﹐ 直到目前為止。 
 So I'm going to give you an example, a very simple example of how this works. ||| 我再來向大家講解一個例子，一個非常簡單嘅例子﹐去說明呢個原理。 
 "So we've all seen these. These are the ""your speed limit"" signs." ||| 我哋每個人都見過呢啲標示牌。呢啲係顯示「你的時速」嘅標示牌。 
 You've seen them all around, especially these days as radars are cheaper. ||| 大家喺任何地方都一定見過， 尤其是而家雷達儀器比較便宜嘅時代。 
 And here's how they work in the feedback loop. ||| 而以下就係佢哋點樣牽涉反饋循環嘅現象。 
 So you start with the personalized data where the speed limit on the road that you are at that point is 25, and, of course, you're going faster than that. ||| 一開始﹐您所得嘅個人化數據﹐就係 您當時於路面嘅時速限制﹐ 25﹐ 而當然﹐您當時正超速。 
 We always are. We're always going above the speed limit. ||| 我哋﹐永遠都會超速。 
 The choice in this case is pretty simple. ||| 呢個例子中嘅選擇係非常簡單。 
 We either keep going fast, or we slow down. ||| 我哋一係就繼續超速，一係就將速度減慢。 
 We should probably slow down, and that point of action is probably now. ||| 其實我哋應該要將速度減慢。 而且大概要立刻行動。 
 We should take our foot off the pedal right now, and generally we do. These things are shown to be pretty effective in terms of getting people to slow down. ||| 我們應該立刻將腳從油門鬆開。 而通常我哋都會咁樣做。呢類設備﹐通常都有效令到 司機將行車速度減慢。 
 They reduce speeds by about five to 10 percent. ||| 佢哋有效將車速減慢百分之五到百分之十。 
 They last for about five miles, in which case we put our foot back on the pedal. ||| 而且有效持續五英哩左右。 之後我哋又再將腳踩落油門。 
 But it works, and it even has some health repercussions. ||| 但至少起作用﹐甚至帶嚟一啲健康嘅效應。 
 Your blood pressure might drop a little bit. ||| 您嘅血壓可能會降低些少。 
 Maybe there's fewer accidents, so there's public health benefits. ||| 亦可能會減少意外發生，因此對大眾健康帶來益處。 
 But by and large, this is a feedback loop that's so nifty and too rare. ||| 但具體嚟講﹐呢類一流嘅反饋環 係少之又少嘅。 
 Because in health care, most health care, the data is very removed from the action. ||| 因為喺醫療系統中，又或者大部份醫療系統中， 數據已經被行動所分離。 
 It's very difficult to line things up so neatly. ||| 因此好難將事件每部份清晰串連起嚟。 
 But we have an opportunity. ||| 但係我哋有呢個機會。 
 So I want to talk about, I want to shift now to think about how we deliver health information in this country, how we actually get information. ||| 因此我而家想轉話題去討論 我哋國家係點樣去將有關醫療信息傳達﹑ 我哋點樣取得呢啲信息。 
 This is a pharmaceutical ad. ||| 呢個係一個西藥嘅廣告。 
 Actually, it's a spoof. It's not a real pharmaceutical ad. ||| 其實呢個係一個諷刺廣告，而唔係真嘅藥品廣告。 
 Nobody's had the brilliant idea of calling their drug Havidol quite yet. ||| 到目前為止﹐未有人聰明到用 「Havidol」為藥品命名。 
 But it looks completely right. ||| 但係佢看似完全冇問題。 
 So it's exactly the way we get health information and pharmaceutical information, and it just sounds perfect. ||| 我哋就係以呢種方法 取得有關健康同藥品嘅資訊﹐ 而且看似非常完美。 
 And then we turn the page of the magazine, and we see this — now this is the page the FDA requires pharmaceutical companies to put into their ads, or to follow their ads, and to me, this is one of the most  cynical exercises in medicine. ||| 跟住我哋翻到雜誌嘅下一頁， 係喇﹐我們可以見到呢個情況。 呢一頁就係食物及藥物管制局﹐要求製藥公司 放入廣告內或附加到廣告後面嘅說明。 而對我而言，呢個動作﹐係醫學界其中一種多餘嘅動作。 
 Because we know. ||| 因為我哋知道 
 Who among us would actually say that people read this? ||| 在座中﹐我哋邊個真係會去睇呢些啲說明呢？ 
 And who among us would actually say that people who do try to read this actually get anything out of it? ||| 又或者在座中﹐我哋邊個真係認為 會有人試圖去睇呢啲說明﹐ 而又真係從中獲益呢? 
 This is a bankrupt effort at communicating health information. ||| 呢個係一個完全殘缺嘅﹑ 去企圖將醫療信息轉達嘅方法。 
 There is no good faith in this. ||| 呢種做法欠缺誠意。 
 So this is a different approach. ||| 以下就係另外一種方法。 
 This is an approach that has been developed by a couple researchers at Dartmouth Medical School, Lisa Schwartz and Steven Woloshin. ||| 係達特茅斯醫學院嘅兩位研究員 想出嚟嘅辦法。 佢哋係 Lisa Schwartz 同埋 Steven Woloshin。 
 "And they created this thing called the ""drug facts box."" They took inspiration from, of all things, Cap'n Crunch." ||| 佢哋將呢個發明稱之為藥物成分說明表。 有趣嘅係﹐佢哋主要係從 Cap'n Crunch 取得靈感。 
 They went to the nutritional information box and saw that what works for cereal, works for our food, actually helps people understand what's in their food. ||| 佢哋見到﹐穀類早餐上嘅營養標籤 就如其他食物標籤一樣﹐實際上真可以有效幫助人 去瞭解自己嘅食物存有甚麼成份。 
 God forbid we should use that same standard that we make Cap'n Crunch live by and bring it to drug companies. ||| 我哋點解未想過﹐ 將 Cap'n Crunch 嘅製造標準﹐ 帶到製藥公司﹖ 
 So let me just walk through this quickly. ||| 請等我簡短地講解。 
 It says very clearly what the drug is for, specifically who it is good for, so you can start to personalize your understanding of whether the information is relevant to you or whether the drug is relevant to you. ||| 佢會清楚說明藥物嘅用途﹐尤其是係使用對象。 咁樣您就可以根據自己情況﹐ 去理解究竟呢段資訊﹑ 又或者呢項藥物﹐是否與您相關。 
 You can understand exactly what the benefits are. ||| 於是您就能清楚知道﹐藥物對您有乜嘢幫助。 
 It isn't this kind of vague promise that it's going to work no matter what, but you get the statistics for how effective it is. ||| 唔再係以往一般﹑含糊地向您保證﹐藥物無論如何都一定有效﹐ 而係透過統計數據令您知道佢點樣有效。 
 And finally, you understand what those choices are. ||| 最後，您就會明白應該作甚麼選擇。 
 You can start to unpack the choices involved because of the side effects. ||| 您可以根據副作用的情況 去收窄要選擇嘅範圍。 
 Every time you take a drug, you're walking into a possible side effect. ||| 每次無論食乜嘢藥，都可能會產生副作用。 
 So it spells those out in very clean terms, and that works. ||| 呢個模式﹐可以清晰令您瞭解佢哋。 而真係有效。 
 So I love this. I love that drug facts box. ||| 所以我非常鐘意呢個辦法。呢個藥物成分說明表。 
 And so I was thinking about, what's an opportunity that I could have to help people understand information? ||| 跟住我開始思考， 我可以利用乜嘢良機 去幫其他人理解呢些信息呢？ 
 What's another latent body of information that's out there that people are really not putting to use? ||| 有乜嘢其他潛在嘅信息 係我哋未有善用呢﹖ 
 And so I came up with this: lab test results. ||| 於是我想到呢個：化驗結果。 
 Blood test results are this great source of information. ||| 血液化驗報告就是這類相當有用嘅信息﹐ 
 They're packed with information. ||| 佢哋充滿一大堆嘅資料。 
 They're just not for us. They're not for people. They're not for patients. ||| 只不過呢種報告唔係比我哋嘅，唔係比普通人嘅，亦唔係比病人嘅。 
 They go right to doctors. ||| 只有醫生才睇得明白。 
 And God forbid — I think many doctors, if you really asked them, they don't really understand all this stuff either. ||| 而天知曉﹐我覺得如果你真係問到，恐怕多數醫生 都未必一定明白呢堆資料。 
 This is the worst presented information. ||| 呢類嘅信息表達實在係最差嘅。 
 "You ask Tufte, and he would say, "Yes, this is the absolute worst presentation of information possible."" ||| 您去問 Tufte﹐佢亦會話﹕ 「係呀﹐呢種信息表達﹐實在差到極點。」 
 What we did at Wired was we went, and I got our graphic design department to re-imagine these lab reports. ||| 喺《連線》雜誌社， 我利用我哋嘅圖表設計部 去重新設計呢啲化驗報告。 
 So that's what I want to walk you through. ||| 呢啲亦都係我想比在座各位見到嘅。 
 So this is the general blood work before, and this is the after, this is what we came up with. ||| 呢份係之前見到嘅血液化驗報告， 而呢張係經過我哋重新設計之後嘅報告。 
 The after takes what was four pages — that previous slide was actually the first of four pages of data that's just the general blood work. ||| 後者將原來嘅四頁紙 — 其實上一張幻燈片 只有顯示四頁資料嘅第一頁， 而呢份只不過係巡例嘅血液化驗部告。 
 It goes on and on and on, all these values, all these numbers you don't know. ||| 呢啲數值﹑您唔明白嘅數字﹐無窮無盡地繼續。 
 This is our one-page summary. ||| 而呢份就是我哋嘅一頁摘要。 
 We use the notion of color. ||| 我哋用顔色加以區分。 
 It's an amazing notion that color could be used. ||| 其實用顔色作區分﹐係非常奇妙嘅概念。 
 So on the top-level you have your overall results, the things that might jump out at you from the fine print. ||| 於最上面一欄﹐係您報告結果嘅概況， 呢啲通常係字裡行間最顯眼嘅要點。 
 Then you can drill down and understand how actually we put your level in context, and we use color to illustrate exactly where your value falls. ||| 然後你可以更詳細看下去， 而實質瞭解﹐我哋點樣將資訊帶到您嘅水平。 我哋通過顔色來清晰表明 您嘅數值處於邊一個位置。 
 In this case, this patient is slightly at risk of diabetes because of their glucose level. ||| 呢個例子裡面﹐據葡萄糖含量可見到 呢個病人存有輕微患糖尿病嘅風險。 
 Likewise, you can go over your lipids and, again, understand what your overall cholesterol level is and then break down into the HDL and the LDL if you so choose. ||| 同樣，您可以見到您嘅血脂含量， 然後瞭解您總體嘅膽固醇含量， 再有興趣的話﹐進一步得知高密度膽固醇及低密度膽固醇嘅程度。 
 But again, always using color and personalized proximity to that information. ||| 但無論如何，都係以顔色 以及個人化關聯 去表達信息。 
 All those other values, all those pages and pages of values that are full of nothing, we summarize. ||| 所有其他嘅數值， 所有果啲無止境嘅一大堆數值，根本毫無意義﹐ 而我哋將佢哋簡化。 
 We tell you that you're okay, you're normal. ||| 我哋會比您知道你情況唔錯﹑一切正常。 
 But you don't have to wade through it. You don't have to go through the junk. ||| 而您無須喺數字堆之中尋覓﹑無須理會雜亂﹑無意義嘅信息。 
 And then we do two other very important things that kind of help fill in this feedback loop: we help people understand in a little more detail what these values are and what they might indicate. ||| 根住我哋還會做兩件非常重要嘅事， 去填補呢個反饋循環存在嘅空隙。 我哋令人明白一點更多嘅細節， 也即是呢啲數值代表甚麼﹑可能表明甚麼。 
 And then we go a further step — we tell them what they can do. ||| 然後我哋更進一步﹕話比病人知道佢哋可以做甚麼。 
 We give them some insight into what choices they can make, what actions they can take. ||| 我哋會幫佢哋洞悉 從而更有效作出選擇﹑採取行動。 
 So that's our general blood work test. ||| 呢份就係我哋嘅基本血液報告。 
 Then we went to CRP test. ||| 跟住我哋再來睇一份C反應蛋白測試。 
 In this case, it's a sin of omission. ||| 今次就係一個嚴重缺失嘅例子。 
 They have this huge amount of space, and they don't use it for anything, so we do. ||| 呢度上面有一大片空白， 既然佢哋冇善用，我哋就嚟將空白加以利用。 
 Now the CRP test is often done following a cholesterol test, or in conjunction with a cholesterol test. ||| 目前﹐C反應蛋白測試通常 都用作跟進膽固醇測試， 或者與膽固醇測試一齊進行。 
 So we take the bold step of putting the cholesterol information on the same page, which is the way the doctor is going to evaluate it. ||| 因此我們大膽地 將膽固醇測試結果放於在同一頁上面， 因為醫生亦都係咁樣用資料作診斷。 
 So we thought the patient might actually want to know the context as well. ||| 所以我哋都覺得﹐病人亦都或者想知道有關來龍去脈。 
 It's a protein that shows up when your blood vessels might be inflamed, which might be a risk for heart disease. ||| 呢個係當您血管有炎症嘅時候， 一種會被驗出來嘅蛋白質， 亦可能係存有患心臟病風險嘅反映。 
 What you're actually measuring is spelled out in clean language. ||| 我哋用易明瞭嘅語言 去顯示報告上嘅信息。 
 Then we use the information that's already in the lab report. ||| 然後我哋用上 化驗報告裡頭已存有嘅資訊。 
 We use the person's age and their gender to start to fill in the personalized risks. ||| 我哋以病人嘅年齡﹑性別 去將佢哋嘅風險作出個人化嘅評估。 
 So we start to use the data we have to run a very simple calculation that's on all sorts of online calculators to get a sense of what the actual risk is. ||| 我哋用手上掌握嘅数據 進行一個非常簡單嘅計算， 網上已經有各式各樣類似嘅計算器﹐ 從而對實際風險作出預測。 
 The last one I'll show you is a PSA test. ||| 最後我展示嘅﹐係前列腺特異性抗原測試。 
 Here's the before, and here's the after. ||| 呢份係修改之前嘅﹑呢份係修改之後嘅。 
 Now a lot of our effort on this one — as many of you probably know, a PSA test is a very controversial test. ||| 我哋喺呢一份化驗報告上﹐下咗好大功夫 — 大概好多人都知道 前列腺特異性抗原測試﹐係一項具有極度爭議嘅測試。 
 It's used to test for prostate cancer, but there are all sorts of reasons why your prostate might be enlarged. ||| 佢係用來檢測病人是否患有前列腺癌﹐ 但實際上有各種原因 會導致前列腺腫脹。 
 And so we spent a good deal of our time indicating that. ||| 因此我哋花咗好多時間 去指出呢一點。 
 We again personalized the risks. ||| 同樣我哋會根據個人情況﹐去評估風險。 
 So this patient is in their 50s, so we can actually give them a very precise estimate of what their risk for prostate cancer is. ||| 例如呢位病人50幾歲﹐ 我哋就能夠精確估計到 佢患前列腺癌嘅風險。 
 In this case it's about 25 percent, based on that. ||| 根據計算，呢個病例嘅風險大概係百分之二十五。 
 And then again, the follow-up actions. ||| 然後又係要採取嘅對策。 
 So our cost for this was less than 10,000 dollars, all right. ||| 我哋做這項工作嘅成本少於一萬美元。 
 That's what Wired magazine spent on this. ||| 呢個數目就係《連線》雜誌於呢方面所花嘅成本。 
 Why is Wired magazine doing this? ||| 點解《連線》雜誌要做呢項工作呢？ 
 (Laughter) Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp, the two largest lab testing companies — last year, they made profits of over 700 million dollars and over 500 million dollars respectively. ||| （笑聲） Quest Diagnostics 以及 LabCorp﹐ 兩間最大規模嘅化驗公司 去年，佢哋分別賺得超過7億 以及5億美元。 
 Now this is not a problem of resources; this is a problem of incentives. ||| 咁樣睇嚟﹐呢個根本唔係資源嘅問題， 而係動機嘅問題。 
 We need to recognize that the target of this information should not be the doctor, should not be the insurance company. ||| 我哋要認清楚﹐呢啲信息嘅目標 並唔應該係醫生，亦唔應該係保險公司， 
 It should be the patient. ||| 而應該係病人。 
 It's the person who actually, in the end, is going to be having to change their lives and then start adopting new behaviors. ||| 最後始終都係病人本身﹐ 要去為自己嘅人生作出改變﹐ 而開始去養成新嘅行為習慣。 
 This is information that is incredibly powerful. ||| 呢啲係具有無窮力量嘅信息。 
 It's an incredibly powerful catalyst to change. ||| 係能促使人類改變嘅強力催化劑。 
 But we're not using it. It's just sitting there. ||| 佢近在咫尺，但係我哋一直冇去將佢善用。 
 It's being lost. ||| 佢不斷流失。 
 So I want to just offer four questions that every patient should ask, because I don't actually expect people to start developing these lab test reports. ||| 所以我只想提出四個問題 每個病人都應該要問呢啲問題 因為我冇指望有人真的會 實質地去製造呢類化驗報告。 
 But you can create your own feedback loop. ||| 但係您可以創造屬於自己嘅反饋環。 
 Anybody can create their feedback loop by asking these simple questions: Can I have my results? ||| 任何人都可以透過問以下幾個簡單嘅問題﹐來創造自己嘅反饋環： 我可以取回我嘅測試結果嗎？ 
 And the only acceptable answer is — (Audience: Yes.) — yes. ||| 而呢個問題只能有一個可接受嘅答案，就係 —— （觀眾：可以）—— 可以。 
 What does this mean? Help me understand what the data is. ||| 呢份報告說明乜嘢﹖請幫我理解呢啲數據代表乜嘢。 
 What are my options? What choices are now on the table? ||| 我有邊啲選擇？邊啲做法係可行？ 
 And then, what's next? ||| 然後又點樣﹖ 
 How do I integrate this information into the longer course of my life? ||| 於未來嘅日子﹐我點樣可以將呢啲資料 運用於生活當中﹖ 
 So I want to wind up by just showing that people have the capacity to understand this information. ||| 結束之前﹐我想令大家知道， 每個人都有能力去理解呢啲信息。 
 This is not beyond the grasp of ordinary people. ||| 呢個並非超出普通人可理解嘅範圍。 
 You do not need to have the education level of people in this room. ||| 無須擁有像在座各位嘅教育程度， 
 Ordinary people are capable of understanding this information, if we only go to the effort of presenting it to them in a form that they can engage with. ||| 普通人已經可以理解呢啲信息， 只要我哋願意為信息嘅表達方面努力， 做到可以容許病人參與嘅模式。 
 And engagement is essential here, because it's not just giving them information; it's giving them an opportunity to act. ||| 喺呢度﹐參與係關鍵因素， 因為不單止關乎向病人提供信息﹐ 更重要嘅係比佢哋行動嘅機會。 
 That's what engagement is. It's different from compliance. ||| 呢個就係參與嘅意義﹔與服從唔同。 
 It works totally different from the way we talk about behavior in medicine today. ||| 呢個同我哋所討論有關現今醫學界嘅行為﹐ 完全唔同。 
 And this information is out there. ||| 而呢啲信息就在眼前。 
 I've been talking today about latent information, all this information that exists in the system that we're not putting to use. ||| 我今日一直講及潛在嘅信息， 呢啲信息存在於呢個體系之中， 而我們卻未有加以利用。 
 But there are all sorts of other bodies of information that are coming online, and we need to recognize the capacity of this information to engage people, to help people and to change the course of their lives. ||| 但仍有大量各種其他信息 正逐漸可於網上取得。 我哋需要認清楚呢啲信息嘅力量， 去吸引人去參與﹑去幫助人， 而且去改變佢哋嘅生命路程。 
 Thank you very much. ||| 多謝大家。 
 (Applause) ||| （掌聲） 
 Now what would this mean, and how would we do it? ||| 咁係咩意思呢？我哋可以點做呢？ 
 Now what could this mean? ||| 咁又代表啲咩呢？ 
 Well if we can embed biological and chemical networks like a search engine, so if you have a cell that's ill that you need to cure or bacteria that you want to kill, if you have this embedded in your device at the same time, and you do the chemistry, you may be able to make drugs in a new way. ||| 如果我哋可以將生物同化學知識 放上搜尋引擎 如果你想治療一個細胞 或者你希望殺死細菌 你將部機連去呢個搜尋引擎 獲取相關嘅做法，進行化學反應時 你或者已經製造出藥物 
 And so you can make your molecule in the printer using this software. ||| 亦即係你可以用呢個軟體 喺打印機度製造你嘅分子 
 Well, ultimately, it could mean that you could print your own medicine. ||| 最終，部機可以令你 印出專屬你自己嘅藥物 
 You don't need to go to the chemist anymore. ||| 你哋再唔需要因為嗰種藥去搵藥劑師 
 Say a new super bug has emerged. ||| 例如話有一種新嘅超級細菌出現 
 You put it in your search engine, and you create the drug to treat the threat. ||| 你就喺資料庫度搵 然後你就會有咗應對呢隻細菌嘅藥 
 So this allows you on-the-fly molecular assembly. ||| 因此部機畀你隨時隨地做分子組合 
 And if that doesn't seem fanciful enough, where do you think we're going to go? ||| 如果咁樣睇落都唔夠吸引 你想我哋仲能夠做啲咩呢？ 
 Well, you're going to have your own personal matter fabricator. ||| 或者，你哋會有個人嘅物質轉換器 
 But so what? ||| 咁又點啫？ 
 So ... ||| 所以… 
 The U.S. News & World Report ranks colleges just as the consumer report rates washing machines. ||| 《美國新聞與世界報導》 公布大學排名嘅方式 十足啲消費報告評估啲洗衣機咁款 
 The language is peppered with barbarisms. ||| 份報告用詞粗暴到極 
 Higher education is also marketed as a status object. ||| 佢哋仲推銷專上教育係地位嘅象徵 
 Diplomas are a brand. ||| 學位已經淪為品牌 
 Let's look at that number more carefully, because on the face of it, it seems to belie the stories we all hear about college grads working as baristas and cashiers. ||| 我哋再細心啲解讀個數字 因為驟眼睇 個數字好似喺度推翻緊嗰啲 「大學畢業做收銀沖咖啡」 之類嘅新聞咁 
 Of 100 people who enroll in any form of post-secondary education, 45 do not complete it in a timely fashion, for a number of reasons, including financial. ||| 响 100 個有專上學歷嘅人裏面 45 個冇順利畢業 原因好多，財政困難係其一 
 Now even economists admit going to college pays off for only those who complete it. ||| 依家連經濟學家都承認 只有順利畢到業嘅大學生先還得哂 
 But that's only because high school wages have been cut to the bone, for decades now. ||| 而純粹係因為中學畢業生嘅薪水 幾廿年嚟大幅縮水 
 For decades, workers with a high school degree have been denied a fair share of what they have produced. ||| 咁多年嚟 有高中學歷嘅人 付出同收入唔成正比 
 And had they received as they should have, then going to college would have been a bad investment for many. ||| 若果佢哋可以賺返佢哋應得嘅水平 咁讀大學對好多人嚟講肯定係蝕大本 
 College premium? ||| 大學畢業生薪水嘅溢價 
 I think it's a high school discount. ||| 我睇都係靠高中畢業生倒貼而嚟 
 And it is they who are going to suffer the most punishing forms of student debt. ||| 而正正係佢哋要去承受 學債帶嚟嘅沉重負擔 
 What if students and parents treated higher education as a consumer product? ||| 如果學生同家長都當學位係商品呢？ 
 One that linked up the cost of a major to the expected income. ||| 計吓個學費同預期人工係咪成正比 
 One of you make this. ||| 係你哋其中一個人設計而嚟 
 Any user can figure out how much money he or she will make from a given college and major. ||| 用戶可以知道 讀完某某大學同埋學系，人工會係幾多 
 There's a second benefit to Income-Based Tuition. ||| IBT 有第二個好處 
 By tying the cost to the income, college administrators would be forced to manage costs better, to find innovative ways to do so. ||| 透過顯示學費同薪金嘅關係 大學管理層必須要運用新思維 去妥善釐訂學費 
 For instance, all of you students here pay roughly the same tuition for every major. ||| 譬如 大部份嘅學生不論學系，學費劃一 
 That is manifestly unfair, and should change. ||| 呢個制度明顯好唔公平，需要改革 
 An engineering student uses more resources and facilities and labs and faculty than a philosophy student. ||| 工程系嘅學生通常用到嘅資源 譬如設施、實驗室、教職員呢啲 會多過哲學系嘅學生 
 Now of course, all this data — and one of you is going to do this, right? ||| 當然啦，而家呢堆資料… 我諗在座會有人走去搞㗎可？ 
 All this data has to be well designed, maybe audited by public accounting firms to avoid statistical lies. ||| 呢堆資料要有人整理好 譬如交畀會計公司做審計 避免畀啲統計數字呃 
 We know about statistics, right? ||| 統計大家都識㗎可？ 
 getting stimulated by their intelligence, follow paths of inquiry that they really want to. ||| 深受知識所啟發 去探索自己渴望探索嘅事物 
 After all, it was Eric and Kevin, two years ago, just exactly these kinds of young men, who prompted me and worked with me, and still do, in the study of indebted students in America. ||| 望返轉頭，其實係阿 Eric 同 Kevin 兩年前 正正係呢一班後生仔 佢哋鼓勵我，同我共事 到到而家 依然落力研究緊美國呢個學生貸款問題 
 Thank you for your attention. ||| 好多謝大家！ 
 (Applause) ||| （鼓掌） 
 It was like having an enormous new toy. ||| 但呢張輪椅就好似一件神奇玩具 
 I could whiz around and feel the wind in my face again. ||| 令我可以出返去吹風 
 Just being out on the street was exhilarating. ||| 而且，可以出到街真係好爽！ 
 But even though I had this newfound joy and freedom, people's reaction completely changed towards me. ||| 雖然重獲自由，我真係好開心 但街外人對我嘅態度就完全唔同晒 
 It was as if they couldn't see me anymore, as if an invisibility cloak had descended. ||| 佢哋好似當我透明 就好似我著咗件隱形斗篷咁 
 They seemed to see me in terms of their assumptions of what it must be like to be in a wheelchair. ||| 佢哋帶住一份成見嚟睇我 覺得我坐輪椅就一定會係點點點 
 "When I asked people their associations with the wheelchair, they used words like ""limitation,"" ""fear,"" "pity" and "restriction."" ||| 當我問「一提起輪椅 你哋會諗起乜嘢？」 佢哋會話「局限」、「恐慌」 「可憐」、「無自由」 
 I realized I'd internalized these responses and it had changed who I was on a core level. ||| 我發現我都受到呢啲成見影響 亦令我從根本對自己嘅睇法唔同咗 
 A part of me had become alienated from myself. ||| 感覺自己有一部份唔再係自己咁 
 (Music) (Applause) It is the most amazing experience, beyond most other things I've experienced in life. ||| （音樂） （掌聲） 呢個係我呢世人至今最精彩嘅體驗 以前種種都無得比 
 I literally have the freedom to move in 360 degrees of space and an ecstatic experience of joy and freedom. ||| 我基本上可以自由咁郁動 360 度通行無阻 體驗至高無上嘅快樂同自由 
 You're all part of the artwork too. ||| 所以你哋都係作品嘅一部份喇！ 
 (Applause) ||| （掌聲） 
 Meet Tony. He's my student. ||| 依位喺東尼，佢喺我唧學生。 
 He's about my age, and he's in San Quentin State Prison. ||| 佢同我差唔多大， 喺圣昆廷州立監獄唧監友。 
 "When Tony was 16 years old, one day, one moment, ""It was mom's gun." ||| 喺佢16歲唧時候， 有一日突然間，事情就咁發生： ”支槍喺媽媽唧。 
 Just flash it, scare the guy. He's a punk. ||| 我開頭諗住求其開一槍，嚇下個飛仔。 
 He took some money; we'll take his money. That'll teach him. ||| 佢搶咗我哋唧錢，我就搶佢唧錢，教訓下佢。 
 "Then last minute, I'm thinking, 'Can't do this. This is wrong.' My buddy says, 'C'mon, let's do this.' I say, 'Let's do this.'"" And those three words, Tony's going to remember, because the next thing he knows, he hears the pop." ||| 到最後，我就諗：‘唔得，我唔可以咁做。’ 我朋友就話：‘快啲啦，快啲開始啦。’ 我就話：‘好啦。’” 就喺依兩個字，東尼永遠都會記住， 因為接落嚟佢見到唧，就喺警察， 
 There's the punk on the ground, puddle of blood. ||| 個飛仔訓喺地上，訓喺血入邊。 
 And that's felony murder — 25 to life, parole at 50 if you're lucky, and Tony's not feeling very lucky. ||| 佢犯咗謀殺罪-25年到終身監禁 如果好彩唧話，50年後會得到假釋， 不過東尼就唔喺咁好彩了。 
 "So when we meet in my philosophy class in his prison and I say, ""In this class, we will discuss the foundations of ethics,"" Tony interrupts me." ||| 當我哋喺監獄唧哲學課見面唧時候， 我話：“依堂課我哋要討論唧喺道德唧基礎，” 東尼就打斷我： 
 """What are you going to teach me about right and wrong?" ||| “你憑咩教我對同錯啊？ 
 I know what is wrong. I have done wrong. ||| 我知咩喺錯唧。我做過錯事。 
 I am told every day, by every face I see, every wall I face, that I am wrong. ||| 每一日每個我見到唧每一個人， 我見到唧每一面墻，都話我知我就喺一個錯誤。 
 If I ever get out of here, there will always be a mark by my name. ||| 只要一日唔離開依度，我就一直都會咩住依個名號。 
 "I'm a convict; I am branded 'wrong.' What are you going to tell me about right and wrong?"" So I say to Tony, ""Sorry, but it's worse than you think." ||| 我喺一個囚犯；我就喺‘錯誤’。 所以你憑咩話我知咩喺對同錯啊？” 我就同東尼講： “唔好意思，不過個問題比你想像中要難。 
 You think you know right and wrong? ||| 你覺得你知道咩喺對同錯？ 
 Then can you tell me what wrong is? ||| 咁你可唔可以話我知咩喺錯？ 
 No, don't just give me an example. ||| 你唔可以齋同我舉例， 
 I want to know about wrongness itself, the idea of wrong. ||| 我想知道錯誤唧本質喺乜嘢， 
 What is that idea? ||| 錯誤唧理念，喺一個點唧理念？ 
 What makes something wrong? ||| 喺乜嘢令一樣嘢變成錯唧？ 
 How do we know that it's wrong? Maybe you and I disagree. ||| 我哋點知一樣嘢喺錯唧？或者你同我唧諗法會唔一樣， 
 Maybe one of us is wrong about the wrong. ||| 或者我哋兩個之中有一個唧諗法喺錯唧。 
 Maybe it's you, maybe it's me — but we're not here to trade opinions; everyone's got an opinion. ||| 可能喺你，可能喺我，但喺我哋唔喺嚟交換思想唧； 個個人都有佢哋自己唧諗法， 
 We are here for knowledge. ||| 我哋喺度唧目的喺學習知識， 
 "Our enemy is thoughtlessness. This is philosophy."" And something changes for Tony." ||| 我哋唧敵人喺輕率。依啲就喺哲學。” 然後東尼就開始有啲改變了。 
 """Could be I'm wrong. I'm tired of being wrong." ||| “可能我唧諗法喺錯唧，我已經厭倦咗一直都喺錯唧， 
 I want to know what is wrong. ||| 我想知咩喺錯誤， 
 "I want to know what I know."" What Tony sees in that moment is the project of philosophy, the project that begins in wonder — what Kant called ""admiration and awe at the starry sky above and the moral law within."" What can creatures like us know of such things?" ||| 我想瞭解多啲我知道唧嘢。” 喺過一刻，東尼見到唧就喺哲學計劃， 一個以奇跡為開端唧計劃— 康德稱之為“頭頂唧星空 同心中唧道德法則，喚起我哋唧讚歎同敬畏。” 作為大地生物之一，我哋又點知道依啲嘢唧呢？ 
 "It is the project that always takes us back to the condition of existence — what Heidegger called ""the always already there."" It is the project of questioning what we believe and why we believe it — what Socrates called ""the examined life."" Socrates, a man wise enough to know that he knows nothing." ||| 就喺依個計劃，一直提醒我哋生存唧條件— 海德格爾稱之為“存在唧意義”。 就喺依個計劃，一直質疑我哋唧信念同佢哋唧原因— 蘇格拉底稱之為“受考驗唧生活”。 蘇格拉底，一個聰明到瞭解自己無知唧男人， 
 Socrates died in prison, his philosophy intact. ||| 佢喺監獄中去世， 不過佢唧哲學得意留存。 
 So Tony starts doing his homework. ||| 東尼開始做佢唧功課， 
 He learns his whys and wherefores, his causes and correlations, his logic, his fallacies. ||| 學習原因、結果同關係， 學習邏輯同謬論， 
 Turns out, Tony's got the philosophy muscle. ||| 最後，佢喺哲學方面變得好專業。 
 His body is in prison, but his mind is free. ||| 雖然佢個人被困喺監獄，但喺佢唧思想卻好自由。 
 Tony learns about the ontologically promiscuous, the epistemologically anxious, the ethically dubious, the metaphysically ridiculous. ||| 東尼仲學識本體論混雜， 認識論焦慮， 倫理性質疑，同埋形而上學既謬論。 
 That's Plato, Descartes, Nietzsche and Bill Clinton. ||| 依啲分別喺柏拉圖、笛卡兒、尼采、 同克林頓唧哲學。 
 "So when he gives me his final paper, in which he argues that the categorical imperative is perhaps too uncompromising to deal with the conflict that affects our everyday and challenges me to tell him whether therefore we are condemned to moral failure, I say, ""I don't know." ||| 然後佢最後交咗佢篇論文， 寫唧喺定言令色 聽落對於我哋日常生活唧矛盾嚟講 有啲太嚴肅， 同時依個話題都條件我要話佢知， 如果我哋犯道德錯誤，系咪就會受到譴責， 我講佢知：“我唔知個答案， 
 "Let us think about that."" Because in that moment, there's no mark by Tony's name; it's just the two of us standing there." ||| 不如我哋一齊諗下。” 喺果一刻，東尼無任何所謂唧身份， 我同佢只喺兩個人， 
 It is not professor and convict, it is just two minds ready to do philosophy. ||| 唔喺教授同囚犯， 只喺兩個準備要討論哲學唧人。 
 "And I say to Tony, "Let's do this."" ||| 然後我就同東尼講： “快啲開始啦！” 
 Thank you. ||| 多謝 
 (Applause) ||| （掌聲） 
 Anyone? ||| 有冇人？ 
 How about a moderate amount of stress? ||| 咁中等嘅壓力呢？ 
 But that is not my confession. ||| 但係呢樣唔係我要坦白嘅 
 When you change your mind about stress, you can change your body's response to stress. ||| 當你改變對壓力嘅睇法時 你就能夠改變身體對壓力嘅反應 
 It's called the social stress test. ||| 呢一個研究叫做社會壓力測試 
 And unbeknownst to you, the experimenter has been trained to harass you during it. ||| 令你措手不及嘅係 實驗人員喺過程中不斷咁騷擾你 
 That guy made a mistake. ||| 呢位男士數錯咗 
 It's getting more oxygen to your brain. ||| 咁會令你嘅大腦獲得更多嘅氧氣 
 I no longer want to get rid of your stress. ||| 我唔再想清除你嘅壓力 
 I want to make you better at stress. ||| 我想讓你哋將壓力處理得更加好 
 And we just did a little intervention. ||| 而我哋只做少少介入療法 
 Now I said I have over a decade of demonizing stress to redeem myself from, so we are going to do one more intervention. ||| 我剛才講過 過去十年我一直將壓力妖魔化 並試圖從壓力裏面釋放自己 所以我想做多一樣嘢 
 But this is a very small part of what oxytocin is involved in. ||| 但係呢樣僅僅係催產素其中一個作用 
 It fine-tunes your brain's social instincts. ||| 佢可以調節大腦嘅社交本能 
 Oxytocin makes you crave physical contact with your friends and family. ||| 催產素令你渴望同 朋友、同家人有身體接觸 
 But here's what most people don't understand about oxytocin. ||| 但係呢正表明大部分嘅人 並唔了解催產素 
 It's a stress hormone. ||| 佢係壓力激素 
 Okay, so how is knowing this side of stress going to make you healthier? ||| 咁樣知道壓力嘅呢一面 點樣令你哋更健康？ 
 It also helps your blood vessels stay relaxed during stress. ||| 佢幫助你嘅血管 喺應對壓力時保持放鬆 
 But my favorite effect on the body is actually on the heart. ||| 但係我最感興趣嘅，係佢對心臟嘅作用 
 People who spent time caring for others showed absolutely no stress-related increase in dying. ||| 嗰啲會關心人嘅人 死亡風險並冇實質嘅增加 —— 係零呀！ 
 Stress gives us access to our hearts. ||| 壓力令得我哋認識心臟 
 And when you choose to view stress in this way, you're not just getting better at stress, you're actually making a pretty profound statement. ||| 當你用呢種方式睇壓力時 你唔單止能夠喺壓力之下做嘅更好 你仲話俾自己聽 
 (Applause) Chris Anderson: This is kind of amazing, what you're telling us. ||| （鼓掌） Chris Anderson：  你話畀我哋知嘅呢啲嘢真係好神奇 
 I am British. ||| 我係英國人 
 "(Laughter) (Applause) Never before has the phrase ""I am British"" elicited so much pity. (Laughter)" ||| （笑聲） （掌聲） 「我係英國人」呢句說話 （笑聲） 
 They blamed the leader of the opposition for not fighting it hard enough. ||| 啲人鬧在野黨黨魁唔夠努力爭取 
 Was it something that took place overnight? ||| 究竟脫歐係咪一夜之間出現呢？ 
 Or are there deeper structural factors that have led us to where we are today? ||| 定係有深層結構性因素 
 So I want to take a step back and ask two very basic questions. ||| 我想退一步，問兩個好基本嘅問題 
 And second, what can we do about it? ||| 第二，我哋可以喺脫歐之後做啲乜？ 
 How should we all respond? ||| 我哋要點樣應對？ 
 So first, what does Brexit represent? ||| 返去第一條問題，英國脫歐代表咩？ 
 Brexit teaches us many things about our society and about societies around the world. ||| 脫歐教曉好多關於我哋社會嘅嘢 以至世界上其他社會嘅嘢 
 Young people didn't turn out to vote in great numbers, but those that did wanted to remain. ||| 年輕人唔踴躍投票 但出咗嚟投票嘅年輕人都投咗留歐 
 Older people really wanted to leave the European Union. ||| 長者想脫歐 
 Those divisions are things we really need to recognize and take seriously. ||| 取態唔同係我哋需要認真看待嘅嘢 
 It's about globalization. ||| 當代政治係講緊全球化 
 But those ideas are ones that signify fear and alienation. ||| 但呢啲脫歐諗法意味住恐懼同孤立 
 They represent a retreat back towards nationalism and borders in ways that many of us would reject. ||| 代表倒退到民族主義同邊界管制嘅年代 而我哋好多人都接受唔到 
 When we look at the voting patterns across the United Kingdom, we can visibly see the divisions. ||| 我哋睇返投票分佈 我哋見到分裂 
 The blue areas show Remain and the red areas Leave. ||| 藍色係留歐 紅色係脫歐 
 It means that we need to reach out more broadly and understand. ||| 即係話我哋要接觸同埋理解更多 
 This replicates around Europe and much of the liberal democratic world. ||| 呢種不滿政制嘅情況喺歐洲 
 We see it with the rise in popularity of Donald Trump in the United States, with the growing nationalism of Viktor Orbán in Hungary, with the increase in popularity of Marine Le Pen in France. ||| 同時，我哋見到特朗普喺美國冒起 匈牙利總理奧班嘅民族主義喺當地冒起 馬琳 · 勒龐喺法國嘅愈嚟愈受歡迎 
 So the question I think we need to ask is my second question, which is how should we collectively respond? ||| 咁我哋就要問第二個問題 我哋要點樣一齊應對？ 
 For all of us who care about creating liberal, open, tolerant societies, we urgently need a new vision, a vision of a more tolerant, inclusive globalization, one that brings people with us rather than leaving them behind. ||| 對於我哋關心營造 我哋急需要新願景 營造更包容同更寛容嘅全球化 令我哋走埋一齊，而唔係拋低邊個 
 But globalization also has redistributive effects. ||| 但全球化有重新分配嘅效果 
 It creates winners and losers. ||| 佢創造贏家同輸家 
 That was the speech in which he coined that term. ||| 佢喺演講裏面創造咗 「包容性全球化」呢個詞 
 "And he said, and I paraphrase, ""The glass house of globalization has to be open to all if it is to remain secure." ||| 我轉述返佢講嘅嘢︰ 「全球化如果要保持穩當嘅話 佢嘅大門就要向所有人打開 
 Globalization has been taken to support a neoliberal agenda. ||| 全球化一直用喺新自由綱領裏面 
 That is the question for all of us. ||| 呢條問題係畀我哋所有人 
 And I think, as a social scientist, that social science offers some places to start. ||| 作為社會科學家 我覺得社會科學係解決問題嘅好開始 
 Our transformation has to be about both ideas and about material change, and I want to give you four ideas as a starting point. ||| 我哋需要係意念上同物質上轉變 我想講四個諗法作為你哋嘅開始 
 The first relates to the idea of civic education. ||| 第一係同公民教育有關 
 It's been suggested that we've moved to a postfactual society, where evidence and truth no longer matter, and lies have equal status to the clarity of evidence. ||| 有人話我哋社會變成唔講事實 證據同真相唔再重要 反而大話同證據有同等地位 
 So how can we — (Applause) How can we rebuild respect for truth and evidence into our liberal democracies? ||| 咁我哋點… （掌聲） 喺呢個自由民主嘅社會裏面 
 It has to begin with education, but it has to start with the recognition that there are huge gaps. ||| 咁就要由教育著手 但要由認識巨大嘅差距開始 
 This illustration from the Financial Times post-Brexit is really striking. ||| 呢幅圖由金融時報做 
 The fourth and final idea I want to put forward is an idea that we need more responsible politics. ||| 第四個，亦係最後一個就係 我哋需要更負責任嘅政治 
 But one hypothesis that I think emerges from a cursory look at that data is the idea that polarized societies are far less tolerant of globalization. ||| 但從呢啲數據得出一個假設係 兩極化社會更加接受唔到全球化 
 And what we see around the world today is a tragic polarization, a failure to have dialogue between the extremes in politics, and a gap in terms of that liberal center ground that can encourage communication and a shared understanding. ||| 但我哋今時今日見到嘅兩極化係悲慘嘅 政治極端兩邊嘅人冇辦法對話 兩班人都失去咗中間自由嘅光譜 而呢個中間地帶 
 I am still British. ||| 我仲係英國人 
 I am still European. ||| 我仲係歐洲人 
 I am still a global citizen. ||| 我仲係世界公民 
 Thank you. ||| 多謝 
 (Applause) ||| （掌聲） 
 I can still remember sort of that smell of rotting flesh as I pulled the curtain back to see her. ||| 我到而家都仲記得拉開塊簾 聞到一陣潰爛味 
 That wasn't being asked. ||| 咁呢當然啦仲使問 
 The cancer was too advanced. ||| 癌症已經好後期 
 You see, unlike the woman the night before, this woman had type 2 diabetes. ||| 同第二位女病人唔同 第一位病人有第二類糖尿病，而且肥胖 
 I mean, how hard can it be? ||| 我嘅意思係 食少啲同做運動有幾難呢？ 
 Why did I feel justified in judging her? ||| 點解我會覺得咁樣評價佢係合理呢？ 
 I'd like to say I don't know. ||| 我想答我唔知道 
 But I actually do. ||| 但我其實心裏面係有原因 
 Yet when it came to a disease like diabetes that kills Americans eight times more frequently than melanoma, I never once questioned the conventional wisdom. ||| 但講到一啲好似糖尿病咁嘅病 比黑色素瘤奪去多八倍美國人嘅病 我從未懷疑過前人知識 
 But this time, I was the patient. ||| 但今次，我係一個病人 
 Now failure to produce enough insulin is incompatible with life. ||| 產生唔到足夠胰島素係難以令人生活 
 I, as you can see, I guess I'm not overweight anymore. ||| 大家見到，我已經唔再超重 
 More importantly, I don't have insulin resistance. ||| 更重要嘅係，抗胰島素無再發生 
 But most important, I was left with these three burning questions that wouldn't go away: How did this happen to me if I was supposedly doing everything right? ||| 但最重要嘅係 我仲有三個急需解決嘅問題︰ 假如我嘅生活習慣係健康 咁點解呢個病係會發生喺我身上呢？ 
 If the conventional wisdom about nutrition had failed me, was it possible it was failing someone else? ||| 如果有關營養嘅舊有知識 對我唔適用嘅話 會唔會對其他人都係咁？ 
 But what if we have it backwards? ||| 但係如果個關係調轉呢？ 
 What if obesity isn't the cause of insulin resistance at all? ||| 如果肥胖根本唔係抗胰島素嘅原因？ 
 Cause and effect. ||| 講到因果關係 
 Let's look at some suggestive facts. ||| 我哋睇下一啲事實 
 It's more likely too much glucose: blood sugar. ||| 而係過多嘅葡萄糖 ，亦即係血糖 
 But that doesn't mean my bias is wrong, and most important, all of this can be tested scientifically. ||| 但咁樣唔代表我嘅偏見係錯 最重要係，全部嘢都可經得起科學驗證 
 I'm betting my career on this. ||| 我亦為呢樣嘢賭上我嘅生涯 
 Today, I devote all of my time to working on this problem, and I'll go wherever the science takes me. ||| 今日，我用我所有時間去研究呢個問題 我會跟著科學嘅指引去做 
 I've decided that what I can't and won't do anymore is pretend I have the answers when I don't. ||| 當我決定無辦法或者唔去做一件事 其實係假扮知道答案 
 I've been humbled enough by all I don't know. ||| 我對於唔知嘅嘢一直好謙虛 
 Some think it's too many calories consumed. ||| 其中有啲認為原因係攝取過多卡路里 
 Others think it's too much dietary fat. ||| 有啲認為係飲食高脂 
 Others think it's too many refined grains and starches. ||| 有啲認為係進食太多加工嘅穀物和澱粉 
 But this team of multi-disciplinary, highly skeptical and exceedingly talented researchers do agree on two things. ||| 呢個團隊雖然嚟自多個範疇 又有好高批判能力同又係好叻 但佢哋同意兩樣嘢 
 First, this problem is just simply too important to continue ignoring because we think we know the answer. ||| 第一，因為我哋以為知道答案 所以可以繼續忽視呢個重要問題 
 I'd like to tell her how sorry I am. ||| 我想同佢講我有幾咁內疚 
 I'd say, as a doctor, I delivered the best clinical care I could, but as a human being, I let you down. ||| 我會講，作為一個醫生 我提供咗最好嘅臨床護理 但作為一個普通人 我令到你失望 
 You didn't need my judgment and my contempt. ||| 你唔需要我嘅批評同埋蔑視 
 If you're watching this now, I hope you can forgive me. ||| 如果你而家睇緊呢一個講座 希望你會原諒我 
 (Applause) ||| （掌聲） 
 Imagine you are a part of a crew of astronauts traveling to Mars or some distant planet. ||| 想像一下你係去火星或者其他遙遠星球 嘅其中一個宇航員 
 The travel time could take a year or even longer. ||| 旅程時間可能長達一年 或者甚至更長 
 What if you could bring with you just a few packets of seeds, and grow crops in a matter of hours? ||| 如果你只可以帶幾袋種子 喺幾個鐘裏面種出作物，會點？ 
 And what if those crops would then make more seeds, enabling you to feed the entire crew with just those few packets of seeds for the duration of the trip? ||| 如果嗰啲作物可以生產更多嘅種子 令你可以用其中嘅幾包種子 全程養活整個團隊，又會點？ 
 Well, the scientists at NASA actually figured out a way to do this. ||| NASA 嘅科學家已經諗到可行嘅方法 
 What they came up with was actually quite interesting. ||| 佢哋嘅諗法非常有趣 
 And they also used hydrogen from water. ||| 科學家同時運用水入面嘅氫氣 
 Astronauts would breathe out carbon dioxide, that carbon dioxide would then be captured by the microbes and converted into a nutritious, carbon-rich crop. ||| 宇航員會呼出二氧化碳 二氧化碳會畀嗰啲微生物吸收 轉化成一種含有豐富營養同碳嘅作物 
 So in this way, a closed-loop carbon cycle is created. ||| 咁樣就建立咗一個閉環碳循環 
 So why is this important? ||| 點解呢樣嘢咁重要？ 
 We need carbon to survive as humans, and we get our carbon from food. ||| 我哋人類需要碳生存 我哋從食物中獲取碳 
 On a long space journey, you simply wouldn't be able to pick up any carbon along the way, so you'd have to figure out how to recycle it on board. ||| 喺漫長嘅太空旅途中 根本就冇可能喺途中搵到碳 所以你要諗點樣喺飛船上循環利用碳 
 This is a clever solution, right? ||| 呢個係一個聰明嘅方法，係唔係？ 
 But the thing is, that research didn't really go anywhere. ||| 但問題係，呢個研究並冇實行過 
 We haven't yet gone to Mars. We haven't yet gone to another planet. ||| 我哋未去過火星，亦未去過其他星球 
 And this was actually done in the '60s and '70s. ||| 事實上呢個研究 喺 60、70 年代就已經完成 
 So a colleague of mine, Dr. John Reed, and I, were interested, actually, in carbon recycling here on Earth. ||| 所以我同一個同事，John Reed 博士 對地球上嘅碳循環好感興趣 
 We wanted to come up with technical solutions to address climate change. ||| 我哋想搵到應對氣候變化嘅 技術性解決方法 
 And we thought it was a really good idea. ||| 我哋覺得呢個真係一個好主意 
 So we said, well, Earth is actually like a spaceship. ||| 我哋認為，地球就好似一艘太空船 
 Could we cultivate these NASA-type microbes in order to make valuable products here on Earth? ||| 我哋可唔可以培養呢啲 NASA 式微生物 用嚟喺地球上生產有價值嘅物品？ 
 We started a company to do it. ||| 我哋創立咗一間公司嚟研究 
 And in that company, we discovered that these hydrogenotrophs — which I'll actually call nature's supercharged carbon recyclers — we found that they are a powerful class of microbes that had been largely overlooked and understudied, and that they could make some really valuable products. ||| 喺呢間公司，我哋發現呢啲氫營養菌 事實上我叫佢哋 我哋發現佢哋係一種強大嘅微生物 佢哋畀嚴重忽視、未被深入研究 而且佢哋確實可以生產 一啲有價值嘅產物 
 So we began cultivating these products, these microbes, in our lab. ||| 所以我哋開始喺實驗室 
 We began cultivating them even further, and we found that we can make oil. ||| 我哋開始更進一步培養 發現我哋可以生產油 
 Oils are used to manufacture many products. ||| 油可以用嚟大量生產好多產品 
 We made an oil that was similar to a citrus oil, which can be used for flavoring and for fragrances, but it also can be used as a biodegradable cleaner or even as a jet fuel. ||| 我哋生產咗一種類似檸檬油嘅油 除咗可以摞嚟調味、製造香水 佢仲可以摞嚟做生物可降解清潔劑 甚至係噴氣燃料 
 And we made an oil that's similar to palm oil. ||| 跟住我哋又生產咗一種類似棕櫚油嘅油 
 Palm oil is used to manufacture a wide range of consumer and industrial goods. ||| 棕櫚油可以用嚟生產唔同嘅 消費品同工業品 
 We believe this type of technology can indeed help us profitably recycle carbon dioxide into valuable products — something that's beneficial for the planet but also beneficial for business. ||| 我哋相信呢種技術可以幫助我哋 將二氧化碳有效轉化為有價值嘅產品 一啲同時對地球 同商業都有益嘅產品 
 That's what we're doing today. ||| 呢啲就係我哋依家做緊嘅事 
 We believe that this type of technology can actually help us address an issue with agriculture and allow us to create a type of agriculture that's sustainable, that will allow us to scale to meet the demands of tomorrow. ||| 我哋相信呢種技術 可以幫助我哋解決農業問題 可以畀我哋發展出一種可持續農業 令我哋可以滿足到未來嘅要求 
 And why might we need a sustainable agriculture? ||| 點解我哋需要一個可持續農業呢？ 
 In addition, we will need many more resources and raw materials to make consumer goods and industrial goods. ||| 同時，我哋會需要更多嘅資源、原材料 去生產消費品、工業品 
 Well, modern agriculture simply cannot sustainably scale to meet that demand. ||| 依家嘅現代農業滿足唔到呢個需求 
 There are a number of reasons why. ||| 原因有好多 
 In fact, it emits more greenhouse gases than our cars, our trucks, our planes and our trains combined. ||| 事實上，佢溫室氣體嘅排放總量 比我哋嘅汽車、貨車、飛機 同埋火車嘅排放總量仲要大 
 Another reason is that modern ag simply takes up a whole lot of land. ||| 另一個原因就係佢佔據咗大面積嘅土地 
 We have cleared 19.4 million square miles for crops and livestock. ||| 我哋為作物、牲畜騰出咗 
 What does that look like? ||| 即係點樣？ 
 Well, that's roughly the size of South America and Africa combined. ||| 大概就係南美洲同非洲加起嚟咁大 
 Let me give you a specific example. ||| 等我舉一個具體嘅例子 
 In Indonesia, an amount of virgin rainforest was cleared totaling the size of approximately Ireland, between 2000 and 2012. ||| 喺印尼，從 2000 年到 2012 年 大概有同成個愛爾蘭咁大嘅 原始熱帶雨林畀移除咗 
 And a natural carbon sink was also removed. ||| 同時，一個天然碳匯都難逃一劫 
 So let me make this real for you. ||| 咁等我講得更加真實一啲 
 This clearing happened primarily to make room for palm plantations. ||| 呢次移除係為咗種植棕櫚樹 
 And as I mentioned before, palm oil is used to manufacture many products. ||| 就好似我之前所講 棕櫚油用於大量生產好多種產品 
 And that includes things like ice cream, cookies ... ||| 其中包括雪糕、曲奇 
 It includes cooking oils. ||| 仲有食用油 
 It also includes detergents, lotions, soaps. ||| 同埋清潔劑、乳液、肥皂 
 You and I both probably have numerous items in our kitchens and our bathrooms that were manufactured using palm oil. ||| 好可能你同我嘅廚房、浴室裏面 都有大量嘅由棕櫚油 製成嘅生活用品 
 So you and I are direct beneficiaries of removed rainforests. ||| 所以你同我都係 移除熱帶雨林嘅罪魁禍首 
 Modern ag has some problems, and we need solutions if we want to scale sustainably. ||| 現代農業存在住一啲問題 如果想可持續發展 
 These supercharged carbon recyclers, like plants, serve as the natural recyclers in their ecosystems where they thrive. ||| 呢種強勁嘅碳循環機 比如植物，喺佢哋成長嘅生態系統中 扮演著「自然循環機」嘅角色 
 And they thrive in exotic places on Earth, like hydrothermal vents and hot springs. ||| 佢哋喺地球嘅特殊地貌生長 比如海底熱泉、溫泉 
 And they're rich in nutrients, such as oils and proteins, minerals and carbohydrates. ||| 佢哋含有豐富營養 譬如油脂、蛋白質 礦物質、碳水化合物 
 And actually, microbes are already an integral part of our everyday lives. ||| 事實上，微生物已經成為 
 If you enjoy a beer from your local microbrewery — a product of microbes. ||| 如果你品嘗當地小型啤酒廠嘅一種啤酒 都係一種微生物嘅產物 
 Or bread, or cheese, or yogurt. ||| 或者係麵包、芝士、酸奶 
 These are all products of microbes. ||| 呢啲全部都係微生物嘅產物 
 But the beauty and power associated with these supercharged carbon recyclers lies in the fact that they can actually produce in a matter of hours versus months. ||| 但呢哋強勁碳循環機嘅魅力、力量在於 佢哋嘅生產力係數以小時計 而唔係以月嚟計算 
 They grow in the dark, so they can grow in any season and in any geography and any location. ||| 作物可以喺黑暗中生長 即係可以喺任何季節 任何地理環境、任何地方生長 
 They can grow in containers that require minimal space. ||| 佢哋可以喺佔地最小嘅容器生長 
 And we can get to a type of vertical agriculture. ||| 咁我哋就可以開發一種垂直農業 
 If we implement this type of approach and use these carbon recyclers, then we wouldn't have to remove any more rainforests to make the food and the goods that we consume. ||| 如果我哋利用呢啲碳循環機 咁我哋就唔再需要為食物、消費品 而移除任何熱帶雨林 
 Ten thousand times over a period of a year. ||| 一年時間收穫係比原先產量嘅一萬倍 
 So this is what I mean by a new type of agriculture. ||| 呢個就我所講嘅新型農業 
 And what would be the products of this new type of agriculture? ||| 咁呢種新型農業可以生產乜嘢？ 
 Well, we've already made a protein meal, so you can imagine something similar to a soybean meal, or even cornmeal, or wheat flour. ||| 我哋已經整咗一種蛋白質餐 咁你可以想像到一啲類似黃豆餐 或者甚至係粟米粉、小麥麵粉嘅產品 
 We've already made oils, so you can imagine something similar to coconut oil or olive oil or soybean oil. ||| 我哋已經生產咗油 咁你可以想像一啲類似椰子油嘅產品 或者係橄欖油、大豆油 
 But it doesn't have to be this way. ||| 但係用新型農業就可以避免 
 We can imagine a future of abundance. ||| 我哋可以想像一個富足嘅未來 
 Thank you very much. ||| 好多謝大家 
 (Applause) ||| （掌聲） 
 But it also presented a gigantic challenge to investigative journalism. ||| 仲為調查新聞界帶嚟巨大嘅挑戰 
 Think about it: 11.5 million documents, containing the secrets of people from more than 200 different countries. ||| 諗一下：1,150 萬份文件 包含來自超過 200 個國家嘅人嘅秘密 
 Where do you start with such a vast resource? ||| 咁大個紀錄，你要從邊度入手？ 
 John Doe had given the information to two journalists at the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung. ||| John Doe 將信息畀咗 德國報社 Süddeutsche Zeitung  嘅兩個記者 
 "He said he was motivated by — and I quote — "The scale of the injustice that the documents would reveal."" ||| 佢話佢出於以下動機︰ 「文件將會揭露不公義嘅規模」 
 (Laughter) By nature, investigative reporters are lone wolves. ||| （笑聲） 就本性而言，調查記者等同孤狼 
 We fiercely guard our secrets, at times even from our editors, because we know that the moment we tell them what we have, they'll want that story right away. ||| 我哋死守自己嘅秘密 甚至連我哋嘅編輯都唔講得 因為我哋知道，只要透露少少風聲 佢哋就會即刻想要嗰篇新聞 
 But there's no doubt that we live in a shrinking world, and that the media has largely been slow to wake up to this. ||| 毫無疑問，我哋生活喺 一個萎縮緊嘅世界 但好多媒體都冇意識到呢一點 
 The issues we report on are more and more transnational. ||| 新聞嘅內容越嚟越國際化 
 Environmental and health crises are global. ||| 環境、健康問題變成全球性 
 So, too, are financial flows and financial crises. ||| 同樣，資金流動同金融危機都係咁 
 The reason journalists are scared of technology is this: the profession's largest institutions are going through tough times because of the changing way that people are consuming news. ||| 記者怕科技嘅原因係： 呢個行業嘅大型機構正經歷緊艱難時期 讀者閱讀新聞嘅方式正係改變緊 
 The advertising business models that have sustained reporting are broken. ||| 以往靠廣告賺錢嘅經營模式成為絕響 
 And this has plunged journalism into crisis, forcing those institutions to reexamine how they function. ||| 令到新聞界陷入危機 迫使新聞機構去審視佢哋嘅運行模式 
 There were nearly five million emails, two million PDFs that needed to be scanned and indexed, and millions more files and other kinds of documents. ||| 呢件事涉及大概五百萬封電子郵件 兩百萬份需要掃描同埋編寫索引嘅 PDF 幾百萬份檔案同埋其他類型嘅文件 
 We next invited reporters to have a look at the documents. ||| 跟住我哋邀請記者去睇下啲文件 
 Who best in Canada than a Canadian? ||| 邊個會比加拿大人更了解加拿大？ 
 There were only two rules for everyone who was invited: we all agreed to share everything that we found with everybody else, and we all agreed to publish together on the same day. ||| 我哋對所有加入嘅記者只有兩個規則： 我哋同意同我哋之間 分享我哋搵到嘅所有信息 我哋同意同一日公開所有資料 
 We used encrypted communication systems, and we built a specially designed search engine. ||| 我哋使用加密嘅溝通系統 我哋用特別嘅搜索引擎 
 For nine months, he refused paid work and lived off the earnings of his wife. ||| 九個月嚟，佢拒絕有薪工作 佢用太太嘅工資生活 
 He pasted tarps over the windows of his home to prevent prying eyes during the long Icelandic winter. ||| 佢將油布黏喺屋企嘅窗度 恐防漫長冬天有人監視 
 Now, when you're an investigative reporter and you make an amazing discovery, such as your prime minster can be linked to a secret offshore company, that that company has a financial interest in Icelandic banks — the very issue he's been elected on — well, your instinct is to scream out very loud. ||| 依家，你係調查記者，你驚奇咁發現 你嘅首相可能同一間秘密海外公司有關 而嗰間公司喺冰島銀行有財務權益 首相嘅當選多得當中利益輸送 咁，你嘅直覺就係大聲咁廣而告之 
 Instead, as one of the few people that he could speak to, Johannes and I shared a kind of gallows humor. ||| 作為佢可以傾訴嘅幾個人之一 我同 Johannes Kristjansson  都係黑色幽默嘅人 
 A new leader was elected in Argentina. ||| 阿根廷選舉選出新任領導人 
 So you can imagine the pressure and the ego dramas that could have ruined what we were trying to do. ||| 所以你可以想像調查時候 嘅壓力同內心掙扎 其實係可以令任何一個記者 唔守約定提早公佈呢份紀錄 
 But they didn't. ||| 但係佢哋冇 
 (Applause) The Panama Papers quickly became one of the biggest stories of the year. ||| （掌聲） 巴拿馬文件成為咗今年嘅一件大事 
 This is the scene in Iceland the day after we published. ||| 呢個係公開咗之後冰島嘅街頭 
 It was the first of many protests. ||| 呢個係第一場抗議 
 The Icelandic prime minister had to resign. ||| 冰島總理被迫辭職 
 It was a first of many resignations. ||| 佢係第一個辭職嘅人 
 And there were some unintended consequences. ||| 文件公開之後仲有一啲意想不到嘅後果 
 These alleged members of a Mexican drug cartel were arrested after we published details about their hideout. ||| 喺我哋將佢哋藏身地點曝光之後 一批聲稱係墨西哥 販毒集團成員嘅人被捕 
 (Laughter) There's a kind of irony in what we've been able to do. ||| （笑聲） 得意嘅係，我哋比以前可以做更多嘅嘢 
 The technology — the Internet — that has broken the business model is allowing us to reinvent journalism itself. ||| 科技同互聯網打破咗傳統商業模式 令我哋能夠改造新聞界本身 
 We put all-important context around what was given to us by John Doe. ||| 我哋根據 John Doe 嘅文件 將重要資料擺埋一齊 
 Now, it was a big risk, and it wouldn't work for every story, but we showed with the Panama Papers that you can write about any country from just about anywhere, and then choose your preferred battleground to defend your work. ||| 但係巴拿馬文件證明咗 你可以喺任何地方報導任何國家嘅新聞 雖然咁樣做有好大風險 而且唔會適合每則新聞 但係你要搵一個地方去捍衛你嘅工作 
 Try obtaining a court injunction that would prevent the telling of a story in 76 different countries. ||| 你要盡力攞到法院指令 避免一單新聞喺 76 個國家報導 
 "Shortly after we published, I got a three-word text from Johannes: "Wintris has arrived."" ||| 發佈新聞後冇幾耐 「Wintris 已經到咗」 
 (Laughter) It had arrived and so, too, perhaps has a new era for journalism. ||| （笑聲） 或者，新聞界嘅新時代亦都嚟咗 
 Thank you. ||| 多謝 
 (Applause) Bruno Giussani: Gerard, thank you. ||| （掌聲） 主持︰多謝你，Gerard 
 Now, a couple of questions I would like to ask. ||| 依家，我有幾個問題要問你 
 Gerard Ryle: We had a series of crises along the way, including when something major was happening in the world, the journalists from that country wanted to publish right away. ||| 講者：一路上我哋遇到咗好多危險 每當世界上發生咗重大事件 嗰個國家嘅記者就會想即刻公開紀錄 
 We'd sent a series of questions to the associates of Vladimir Putin, but instead of responding, the Kremlin actually held a press conference and denounced us, and denounced the whole thing as being, I guess, a plot from the West. ||| 我哋向普京嘅密友提咗一咋問題 但克裡姆林宮冇回答到 反而克裡姆林宮搞咗記幾招指責我哋 話成件事係西方嘅陰謀 
 At that point, Putin thought it was just about him. ||| 嗰時，普京認為呢件事凈係同佢有關 
 They thought the story was going to get out. ||| 佢哋覺得成件事就快要爆 
 And then eventually, of course, they all did. ||| 最終，當然，佢哋都係淡定返 
 BG: And then a couple weeks ago or so, you released a lot of the documents as an open database for everybody to search via keyword, essentially. ||| 主持：大概喺幾個星期之前 你發佈咗好多文件 畀大家通過關鍵字嚟搜索 
 GR: Thank you. ||| 講者：多謝 
 (Applause) ||| （掌聲） 
 I'd like to talk to you today about the scale of the scientific effort that goes into making the headlines you see in the paper. ||| 今日我想同大家講下 要創造一篇你們在報紙上看到的頭條 所蘊含的科研投入的程度 
 Headlines that look like this when they have to do with climate change, and headlines that look like this when they have to do with air quality or smog. ||| 像這個關於氣候變化的頭條 還有這個跟空氣質量和濃霧有關的頭條 
 They are both two branches of the same field of atmospheric science. ||| 它們是大氣科學的不同分支研究 
 Recently the headlines looked like this when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, put out their report on the state of understanding of the atmospheric system. ||| 近來的頭條是這個樣子的，當政府間氣候變化專門委員 簡稱IPCC 提交對於大氣系統的瞭解狀況報告的時候 
 That report was written by 620 scientists from 40 countries. ||| 該份報告由620位科學家共同撰寫 它們來自40個國家 
 They wrote almost a thousand pages on the topic. ||| 寫出了幾近一千頁的報告 
 And all of those pages were reviewed by another 400-plus scientists and reviewers, from 113 countries. ||| 而每一頁又都經過另外400多位 來自113個國家的科學家和審稿人的審核才發表 
 It's a big community. It's such a big community, in fact, that our annual gathering is the largest scientific meeting in the world. ||| 這是一個龐大的團隊。事實上，它大到讓 我們的年會變成了世界上最大的科學家聚會 
 Over 15,000 scientists go to San Francisco every year for that. ||| 每年有超過一萬五千名科學家會齊聚在三藩市參加年會 
 And every one of those scientists is in a research group, and every research group studies a wide variety of topics. ||| 而每一位與會者都是一個研究團隊的成員 每一個研究團隊致力於一系列不同課題的研究 
 For us at Cambridge, it's as varied as the El Niño oscillation, which affects weather and climate, to the assimilation of satellite data, to emissions from crops that produce biofuels, which is what I happen to study. ||| 對於我所在的劍橋的團隊，研究範疇包括從影響天氣和氣候的 厄爾尼諾現象 到衛星數據的同化 以及製造生物燃料的作物的排量等，最后這項剛好也是我的研究內容 
 And in each one of these research areas, of which there are even more, there are PhD students, like me, and we study incredibly narrow topics, things as narrow as a few processes or a few molecules. ||| 而在每一個研究領域之中有更多 同我一樣的博士研究生 我們研究的是非常狹小的課題 專門到某一小部份進程或者某幾個分子的研究 
 And one of the molecules I study is called isoprene, which is here. It's a small organic molecule. You've probably never heard of it. ||| 而我所研究的其中一個分子是異戊二烯(isoprene) 就在這裡。它是一個很小的有機分子。你可能從未有聽講過。 
 The weight of a paper clip is approximately equal to 900 zeta-illion — 10 to the 21st — molecules of isoprene. ||| 一個回形針的重量大概相當於 900 × 6 × 10^23－約10的21次方個異戊二烯分子 
 But despite its very small weight, enough of it is emitted into the atmosphere every year to equal the weight of all the people on the planet. ||| 雖然輕若無物 每年釋放到大氣中的數量 卻足以抵上地球上全人類的重量 
 It's a huge amount of stuff. It's equal to the weight of methane. ||| 數量之大與甲烷的重量相當 
 And because it's so much stuff, it's really important for the atmospheric system. ||| 正因為如此，它對於大氣系統有舉足輕重的影響 
 Because it's important to the atmospheric system, we go to all lengths to study this thing. ||| 也正是由此 我們竭盡全力去研究它 
 We blow it up and look at the pieces. ||| 把它分解爆破再研究所得的碎片 
 This is the EUPHORE Smog Chamber in Spain. ||| 这是位于西班牙的EUPHORE烟雾舱 
 Atmospheric explosions, or full combustion, takes about 15,000 times longer than what happens in your car. ||| 虽然这里大气爆炸完全燃烧要比 私家车慢1.5萬倍 
 But still, we look at the pieces. ||| 我们仍旧要分析这些碎片 
 We run enormous models on supercomputers; this is what I happen to do. ||| 我们用超级计算机做大量的模型演算 这个刚好是我做的事 
 Our models have hundreds of thousands of grid boxes calculating hundreds of variables each, on minute timescales. ||| 我們的模型佔據成千上萬個網格箱 每個負責計算上百個變量以一分鐘為單位的變化 
 And it takes weeks to perform our integrations. ||| 整合這些數據需要數個星期時間 
 And we perform dozens of integrations in order to understand what's happening. ||| 而我們要做幾十種整合 來瞭解正在發生的狀況 
 We also fly all over the world looking for this thing. ||| 我們還飛到世界各地去尋找這種分子 
 I recently joined a field campaign in Malaysia. There are others. ||| 最近我就為此和同伴們去了馬來西亞考察。 
 We found a global atmospheric watchtower there, in the middle of the rainforest, and hung hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of scientific equipment off this tower, to look for isoprene, and of course, other things while we were there. ||| 我們在那裡發現了一個全球大氣瞭望塔 它位於熱帶雨林的中央。我們在那裡懸掛了價值數十萬 美金的科學儀器 用來尋找異戊二烯 當然，亦都觀察其他的東西 
 This is the tower in the middle of the rainforest, from above. ||| 這是從上方觀察到的雨林中的瞭望塔 
 And this is the tower from below. ||| 這是由下至上的角度 
 And on part of that field campaign we even brought an aircraft with us. ||| 我們還為這次的實地考察配備了飛機 
 And this plane, the model, BA146, which was run by FAAM, normally flies 120 to 130 people. ||| 型號為BA146，屬於FAAM(氣測量飛行設備公司) 通常可以運載120到130人 
 So maybe you took a similar aircraft to get here today. ||| 你們今天有可能是乘坐類似的機型抵達這裡 
 But we didn't just fly it. We were flying at 100 meters above the top of the canopy to measure this molecule — incredibly dangerous stuff. ||| 但是，我們並不僅僅是乘客而已。我們的飛行高度為樹冠上空100米 這是爲了測量分子， 不過也是危險行為 
 We have to fly at a special incline in order to make the measurements. ||| 我們需要以特殊的傾斜角度飛行來進行測量 
 We hire military and test pilots to do the maneuvering. ||| 所以聘請了軍事和測試飛行員來操作飛機 
 We have to get special flight clearance. ||| 我們需要獲得特殊的飛行許可 
 And as you come around the banks in these valleys, the forces can get up to two Gs. ||| 當環繞這些山谷斜坡飛行時，重力可達2G 
 And the scientists have to be completely harnessed in in order to make measurements while they're on board. ||| 所以科學家們必須全程系緊安全帶 才能在飛行期間做測量工作 
 So, as you can imagine, the inside of this aircraft doesn't look like any plane you would take on vacation. ||| 正如你所想像的 這架飛機的內部和你們度假是乘坐的那些完全不一樣 
 It's a flying laboratory that we took to make measurements in the region of this molecule. ||| 它是一個飛行中的實驗室，我們用它來對該地區的這一分子進行測量 
 We do all of this to understand the chemistry of one molecule. ||| 我們所做的一切都是爲了瞭解一個分子的化學性質 
 And when one student like me has some sort of inclination or understanding about that molecule, they write one scientific paper on the subject. ||| 當像我這樣的學生對一個分子有了某種想法 或瞭解以後 他們會以此寫一篇科學論文 
 And out of that field campaign we'll probably get a few dozen papers on a few dozen processes or molecules. ||| 從那一次的實地考察裏面我們大概可以 寫出關於幾十個過程或分子的十來篇論文 
 And as a body of knowledge builds up, it will form one subsection, or one sub-subsection of an assessment like the IPCC, although we have others. ||| 而當知識量建立起來以後 它就會成為像IPCC這樣的評估中的一個副章節，或者是其下屬的子部份 當然我們還有其他的評估 
 And each one of the 11 chapters of the IPCC has six to ten subsections. ||| IPCC報告的11個章節當中 每一章都有六到十個副章節 
 So you can imagine the scale of the effort. ||| 這樣你就可以想像其中需要付出的努力有多少 
 In each one of those assessments that we write, we always tag on a summary, and the summary is written for a non-scientific audience. ||| 在我們撰寫的每一份評估當中 都會包含一個摘要 摘要是寫給沒有科學背景的讀者的 
 And we hand that summary to journalists and policy makers, in order to make headlines like these. ||| 我們把摘要提供給記者和決策者 用來製作這樣的頭條 
 Thank you very much. ||| 謝謝 
 (Applause) ||| (掌聲) 
 A language dies every 14 days. ||| 每 14 日就有一種語言消失 
 But I do know that I've seen a lot of changes. ||| 但我知我見證好多轉變 
 Okay. ||| 言歸正傳 
 We English teachers are the gatekeepers. ||| 我哋英語老師嘅工作就係把關 
 It feeds the English requirement. ||| 有英語需求自然就有英語供給 
 Do we really want to end up with 600 languages and the main one being English, or Chinese? ||| 唔通我哋真希望世界剩返 600 種語言 其中以英文或者中文做主流？ 
 We need more than that. Where do we draw the line? ||| 世界需要更多語言 
 They want to give their children the best chance in life. ||| 因為佢哋想孩子得到最好嘅機會 
 It's a circular thing. ||| 呢個係一種循環 
 It's an Arabic-medium school. ||| 佢用阿拉伯文讀科學同數學 
 She had to translate it into English at her grammar school. ||| 喺英國文法學校裡面 佢要翻譯所有嘢做英文 
 Let us celebrate diversity. ||| 等我哋一齊為語言多元化歡呼 
 Mind your language. ||| 好好保護你母語 
 Use it to spread great ideas. ||| 用佢嚟傳播偉大嘅諗法 
 The lady answered on the other end and I told her what I wanted. ||| 接電話嘅係一個女人 
 "When I knocked on the door,  the woman came to the door, and she looked at me, and she said, ""Can I help you?"" I said, ""Yes, I'm the person  who called about the apartments." ||| 去到，我敲門啦，一個女士開門 佢睇一睇我，問： 「有乜可以幫到你嗎？」 我答話：「我頭先打嚟話睇屋， 想睇下邊間合適。」 
 Nor did I get any responses  from the other people that they gave me on the list where I could get apartments. ||| 嗰份名單上面其他業主我都打過 但係都冇回音 
 His name was McDow, Major McDow. ||| McDow 少校 
 But you know the problem: We can't make people rent to folks  that they don't want to rent to. ||| 但問題係， 我哋唔能夠迫人 將屋租俾佢哋唔鍾意嘅人。 
 "So once a year, you can go home to your family, spend 30 days and then come on back."" Needless to say, that didn't resonate for me." ||| 你趁假期返返去， 三十日後再返嚟。」 但佢冇說服到我 
 I went to one after another,  after another. ||| 我逐個逐個搵 
 I mean, a really small trailer park. ||| 細到冇人有嘅停車場 
 It didn't have a laundry facility. ||| 冇可以洗衫嘅設施 
 And of course, eventually things settled down. ||| 當然，事情最後都安定落嚟 
 She'll be with us as we drive, she'll help us manage the children. ||| 佢會喺開車嗰陣幫我哋照顧細路 
 So she came out, her and Alice  put a lot of food together for the trip. ||| 所以媽咪就嚟咗 
 That morning, we left at about 5 a.m. ||| 嗰日上晝，我哋五點就出發 
 Great trip, having a great time,  good conversation. ||| 成個旅程都好好，大家都好鍾意 
 So we stopped in. ||| 我哋就停低 
 They were in the parking lot,  I went inside. ||| 佢哋留喺停車場 
 When I walked inside, the lady was just finishing up  one contract with some folks, some other people  were coming in behind me. ||| 當我入去嘅時候 前台嘅一位女職員 啱啱辦埋完幾個人嘅入住手續 另一啲人嚟到前台，企喺我後面 
 She looked at me and I looked at her. ||| 佢望一望我，我望一望佢 
 There were other people in the room. ||| 大堂裡面仲有其他人 
 So I just got the hint and I left, and went outside to the parking lot. ||| 我明白意思 
 The light came back on. ||| 吉房嘅招牌光管竟然又著咗！ 
 "And it said, ""Vacancies,  Vacancies, Vacancies."" We were able to find a nice place." ||| 依然著住「有空房，有空房，有空房」 最後我哋搵到一個唔錯嘅地方 
 But we made it to Pennsylvania. ||| 但我哋最後仍然能夠嚟到賓夕法尼亞州 
 We got the family settled. Everyone was glad to see the kids. ||| 我哋成家人安定落嚟 
 I jumped on a plane and shot off to Goose Bay, Labrador, which is another story, right? ||| 今次另一個故仔係當我坐飛機趕去 Labrador Goose Bay 嘅時候 唔係咩？ 
 (Laughter) Here it is, 53 years later, I now have nine grandchildren,  two great-grandchildren. ||| （笑聲） 即係 53 年後嘅今日 我有九個孫，兩個曾孫 
 Five of the grandchildren are boys. ||| 五個孫係男丁 
 I have master's, Ph.D., undergrad, one in medical school. ||| 有讀學士、碩士、博士，其中一個讀醫 
 I have a couple that are trending. ||| 有幾個孫都幾時髦 
 He doesn't have a degree yet,  but he wants to be a comedian. ||| 佢仲未攞到學位 
 So with that being the backdrop, I was sitting in my TV room watching TV, and they were talking about Ferguson and all the hullabaloo that was going on. ||| 呢個係我少少背景 噉有一日我喺度睇電視 電視播梗 Ferguson 同埋相關嘅騷動 
 What can we do? We do everything that you told us to do. ||| 我哋可以做啲乜？ 
 You need to push back. You need to challenge. ||| 你應該要反抗，你應該要理論， 
 How do I keep them safe? How do I keep them alive? ||| 我點先能夠保護佢哋嘅安全 俾佢哋繼續好好咁活著呢？ 
 The second thing I do is this: I want to appeal to Americans. ||| 我要做嘅第二件事係︰ 我要呼籲所有美國人 
 We have to challenge that. It doesn't make any sense. ||| 我哋必須推翻呢啲唔合理嘅啲事 
 "Have you ever been asked by your Chinese friend, "What is your zodiac sign?"" ||| 各位有無試過畀你嘅中國朋友問 「你係乜嘢生肖？」 
 Don't think they are making small talk. ||| 唔好以為佢哋同你傾閒計 
 "If you say, ""I'm a Monkey,"" they immediately know you are either 24, 36, 48 or 60 years old." ||| 如果你話：「我係屬 佢哋即刻知道 你嘅年齡一定係 24、36、48 或者 60 歲 
 (Laughter) Asking a zodiac sign is a polite way of asking your age. ||| （笑聲） 問人屬乜嘢生肖係問人年齡嘅禮貌方法 
 By revealing your zodiac sign, you are also being evaluated. ||| 你講咗自己嘅生肖，人哋就會幫你算命 
 Judgments are being made about your fortune or misfortune, your personality, career prospects and how you will do in a given year. ||| 佢哋算下你會行好運定係唔好運 你嘅性格、事業前程 同你會喺某一年點樣過 
 If you share you and your partner's animal signs, they will paint a picture in their mind about your private life. ||| 如果你將自己同伴侶嘅生肖話畀人聽 佢哋嘅腦海就有咗你私生活嘅畫面 
 Maybe you don't believe in the Chinese zodiac. ||| 或者你唔信中國生肖運程 
 As a quarter of the world population is influenced by it, you'd be wise to do something about that. ||| 但佢影響全世界嘅四分一人口 你最好認識下佢比較好 
 So what is the Chinese zodiac, exactly? ||| 到底乜嘢係中國生肖呢？ 
 Most Westerners think of Greco-Roman zodiac, the signs divided into 12 months. ||| 多數西方人都會諗起希臘羅馬嘅星座 佢哋將星座分為十二個月 
 The Chinese zodiac is different. ||| 中國嘅十二生肖就唔同 
 It's a 12-year cycle labeled with animals, starting with a Rat and ending with a Pig, and has no association with constellations. ||| 佢係用動物命名，每十二年一個循環 排頭位嘅係老鼠，最尾嘅係豬 呢啲運程同星座無關 
 For example, if you were born in 1975, you are a Rabbit. ||| 例如你係 1975 年出世，咁你屬兔 
 Can you see your zodiac sign there? ||| 你見唔見嗰度有屬於你嘅生肖？ 
 Our Chinese ancestors constructed a very complicated theoretical framework based on yin and yang, the five elements and the 12 zodiac animals. ||| 我哋嘅祖先根據陰陽五行同十二生肖 做咗一個好複雜嘅理論架構 
 Over thousands of years, this popular culture has affected people's major decisions, such as naming, marriage, giving birth and attitude towards each other. ||| 經過幾千年以嚟 呢啲通俗文化已經影響人民做重大決定 譬如改名、結婚、生仔同人際關係 
 And some of the implications are quite amazing. ||| 有時會出現啲出人意表嘅結果 
 The Chinese believe certain animals get on better than the others. ||| 中國人相信有啲生肖比其他生肖匹配 
 So parents choose specific years to give birth to babies, because they believe the team effort by the right combination of animals can give prosperity to families. ||| 於是夫婦會揀特定嘅年份生仔 因為佢哋相信大家生肖配合 群策群力可以為家族帶來繁榮 
 We even refer to the zodiac when entering into romantic relations. ||| 我哋搵伴侶都要睇下生肖運程 
 I'm a Pig; I should have perfect romance with Tigers, Goats and Rabbits. ||| 我屬豬，咁同老虎、羊仲有兔都會好夾 
 Chinese people believe some animals are natural enemies. ||| 中國人相信有啲動物天生相沖 
 As a Pig, I need to be careful with a Snake. ||| 我屬豬, 所以要小心屬蛇嘅朋友 
 Raise your hand if you are a Snake. ||| 在座邊個係屬蛇嘅，唔該舉舉手 
 Let's have a chat later. ||| 我哋遲啲傾吓 
 (Laughter) We believe some animals are luckier than the others, such as the Dragon. ||| （笑聲） 我哋相信有啲動物比其他動物好運 譬如龍 
 Unlike the Western tradition, the Chinese Dragon is a symbol for power, strength and wealth. ||| 唔似西方嘅傳統習慣 中國嘅龍象徵權力同財富 
 It's everyone's dream to have a Dragon baby. ||| 所以每個人都夢想生個龍仔龍女 
 Jack Ma's parents must have been very proud. ||| 馬雲嘅父母一定為佢覺得驕傲 
 And they are not the only ones. ||| 佢哋唔會係唯一孤獨嘅父母 
 In 2012, the Year of the Dragon, the birthrate in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan increased by five percent. ||| 2012 年係龍年 中國、香港同台灣嘅出生率 增加咗 5% 
 That means another one million more babies. ||| 即係代表比平時多咗一百萬有多嘅嬰兒 
 With a traditional preference to baby boys, the boy-girl ratio that year was 120 to 100. ||| 由於中國傳統偏愛男嬰 男仔同女仔喺呢一年係 120 :100 
 When those Dragon boys grow up, they will face much more severe competition in love and job markets. ||| 當呢啲龍仔大個之後 喺戀愛同搵工都會競爭得好犀利 
 According to the BBC and the Chinese government's press release, January 2015 saw a peak of Cesarean sections. ||| 根據 BBC 同中國政府嘅新聞發布 2015 年 1 月係剖腹生產手術嘅高峰 
 Why? ||| 點解？ 
 That was the last month for the Year of the Horse. ||| 因為呢個係馬年嘅最後一個月 
 It's not because they like horses so much, it's because they try to avoid having unlucky Goat babies. ||| 佢哋唔係特別鍾意馬年 而係唔想生個唔好運嘅羊仔 
 (Laughter) If you are a Goat, please don't feel bad. ||| （笑聲） 如果你屬羊，唔好唔開心 
 Those are Goat babies. ||| 呢啲人都係羊仔羊女 
 They don't look like losers to me. ||| 佢哋睇嚟都唔似輸家 
 (Laughter) Tiger is another undesirable animal, due to its volatile temperament. ||| （笑聲） 老虎係另一隻唔受歡迎嘅動物 因為老虎性格變幻無常 
 Many Chinese regions saw a sharp decline of birthrate during those years. ||| 好多中國地區喺呢啲生肖年份 都見到出生率急劇下降 
 Perhaps one should consider zodiac in reverse, as those Tiger and Goat babies will face much less competition. ||| 或者我哋應該反過嚟睇 呢啲虎年同羊年嘅嬰兒面對少啲競爭 
 Maybe they are the lucky ones. ||| 可能佢哋係幸運兒 
 I went through the Forbes top 300 richest people in the world, and it's interesting to see the most undesirable two animals, the Goat and Tiger, are at the top of the chart, even higher than the Dragon. ||| 我喺福布斯查過世界頭三百個有錢人 發現一件有趣嘅嘢 就係大家最唔想做嘅老虎 同羊呢兩個生肖 竟然名列榜首 甚至高過龍 
 So maybe we should consider, maybe it's much better to have less competition. ||| 咁樣我哋或者要諗下 面對少啲競爭可能仲好 
 One last but interesting point: many Chinese people make their investment decisions based on the zodiac sign index. ||| 最後一點但係喺最有趣嘅一點 好多中國人根據生肖運程 嚟做投資決定 
 Although the belief and tradition of the zodiac sign has been over thousands of years, the trend of using it in making major decisions did not really happen until the past few decades. ||| 雖然人民信賴生肖嘅傳統 已經超過幾千年 但係人民利用生肖做重大嘅決定 直到呢幾十年，呢種熱潮先真正出現 
 Our ancestors were very busy surviving poverty, drought, famine, riot, disease and civil war. ||| 以前我哋嘅祖先為咗生計奔波 要抵受貧窮飢荒 乾旱、疾病同內戰暴亂 
 And finally, Chinese people have the time, wealth and technology to create an ideal life they've always wanted. ||| 最後中國人多咗時間，財富同科技 去創造自己一直希望嘅理想生活 
 The collective decision made by 1.3 billion people has caused the fluctuation in economics and demand on everything, from health care and education to property and consumer goods. ||| 十三億人集體做嘅決定 已經令到經濟波動，佢哋每樣嘢都需要 由醫療服務，教育到房屋同消費品 
 As China plays such an important role in the global economy and geopolitics, the decisions made based on the zodiac and other Chinese traditions end up impacting everyone around the world. ||| 中國喺世界經濟同地緣政治都好重要 佢哋根據生肖同其他中國傳統做決定 最後會影響到全世界每一個人 
 Are there any Monkeys here? ||| 呢度有無猴年出世嘅人 
 2016 is the Year of the Monkey. ||| 2016 係猴年 
 Monkeys are clever, curious, creative and mischievous. ||| 猴子生性聰明、好奇、多計同頑皮 
 Thank you. ||| 多謝 
 (Applause) ||| （掌聲） 
 I want to talk to you about something kind of big. ||| 有啲嘢我想講俾你地聽 係好大件事 
 We'll start here. ||| 我地由呢度開始 
 65 million years ago the dinosaurs had a bad day. ||| 六千五百萬年前 啲恐龍好慘 
 (Laughter) A chunk of rock six miles across, moving something like 50 times the speed of a rifle bullet, slammed into the Earth. ||| （笑） 有一塊寬六英里嘅石頭飛落來 速度大概係 步槍子彈嘅五十倍 撞係地球上 
 It released its energy all at once, and it was an explosion that was mind-numbing. ||| 佢即刻一次過釋放晒所有能量 而且引起咗爆炸 大聲到震耳欲聾 
 If you took every nuclear weapon ever built at the height of the Cold War, lumped them together and blew them up at the same time, that would be one one-millionth of the energy released at that moment. ||| 如果你將所有係冷戰高峰時期 製造出來嘅原子彈 係同一時間 綁埋一齊之後引爆 噉就會釋放出 小行星能量嘅百萬分之一 
 The dinosaurs had a really bad day. ||| 啲恐龍真係好慘 
 Okay? ||| 是咪咁呢 
 Now, a six-mile-wide rock is very large. ||| 依家，六英里寬嘅石頭是非常之大嘅 
 We all live here in Boulder. ||| 我們都住係博爾德 
 If you look out your window and you can see Long's Peak, you're probably familiar with it. ||| 如果你望出窗外你可以睇到朗斯山峰 你好可能覺得佢好熟悉 
 Now, scoop up Long's Peak, and put it out in space. ||| 依家，將朗斯山峰掘出來 將佢放係太空裡邊 
 Take Meeker, Mt. Meeker. Lump that in there, and put that in space as well, and Mt. Everest, and K2, and the Indian peaks. ||| 將米克山拎出來 同樣擺係太空裡邊 仲有珠穆朗瑪峰同埋K2 同埋印第安山峰 
 Then you're starting to get an idea of how much rock we're talking about, okay? ||| 然之後你就知 我地係度講緊幾多石頭，是咪 
 We know it was that big because of the impact it had and the crater it left. ||| 我地知佢有咁大係因為 佢嘅衝擊力同埋佢留低嘅隕石坑 
 It hit in what we now know as Yucatan, the Gulf of Mexico. ||| 佢撞到今日墨西哥灣 嘅猶加敦 
 You can see here, there's the Yucatan Peninsula, if you recognize Cozumel off the east coast there. ||| 你可以睇到呢度就係猶加敦半島 如果你可以認出 東海岸嘅科蘇梅爾 
 Here is how big of a crater was left. ||| 呢度可以睇到個坑有幾大 
 It was huge. To give you a sense of the scale, okay, there you go. The scale here is 50 miles on top, a hundred kilometers on the bottom. This thing was 300 kilometers across — 200 miles — an enormous crater that excavated out vast amounts of earth that splashed around the globe and set fires all over the planet, threw up enough dust to block out the sun. ||| 個坑非常之大，俾你feel下佢嘅規模 你地睇 佢上邊有五十英里寬 下邊有一百公里寬 呢嚿嘢成三百公里寬或者兩百英里寬 由一個好大嘅坑里便掘出咗 好多四濺係地球上嘅泥土 仲引起咗地球上嘅大火 升起嘅塵埃足以遮住太陽 
 It wiped out 75 percent of all species on Earth. ||| 佢毀滅咗地球上 全部生物嘅百分之七十五 
 Now, not all asteroids are that big. ||| 不過唔係所有嘅小行星都咁大 
 Some of them are smaller. ||| 有啲比較細粒 
 Here is one that came in over the United States in October of 1992. ||| 呢度有一個小行星 落到美國 時間係1992年10月 
 It came in on a Friday night. ||| 佢係星期五晚上飛落來 
 Why is that important? ||| 點解呢個咁重要呢 
 Because back then, video cameras were just starting to become popular, and people would bring them, parents would bring them, to their kids' football games to film their kids play football. And since this came in on a Friday, they were able to get this great footage of this thing breaking up as it came in over West Virgina, Maryland, Pennsylvania and New Jersey until it did that to a car in New York. ||| 因為當時 攝像機剛開始流行 啲人呢就會將佢地帶係身邊 爹地媽咪帶住攝像機去拍仔女嘅足球比賽 星期五呢個小行星落咗落來 啲人就可以連續記錄低小行星 一路穿過...... 而且越來越細 直到佢擊中咗 一部係紐約嘅車 
 (Laughter) Now, this is not a 200-mile-wide crater, but then again you can see the rock which is sitting right here, about the size of a football, that hit that car and did that damage. ||| （笑） 依家，呢個唔係一個200英尺寬嘅坑 但跟住落來你地可以睇到 位於呢度嘅岩石 同一個足球差唔多大 衝爛咗嗰部車 
 Now this thing was probably about the size of a school bus when it first came in. ||| 不過當呢個小航行進入地球時 可能係一部校車嘅晒士 
 It broke up through atmospheric pressure, it crumbled, and then the pieces fell apart and did some damage. ||| 由於大氣壓，佢開始分裂 變得破碎，小塊岩石又碎開 造成咗一點損害 
 Now, you wouldn't want that falling on your foot or your head, because it would do that to it. ||| 依家，你一定唔會希望佢 落係你腳上或者頭上，因為會佢會令你好痛 
 That would be bad. ||| 呢係一件好慘嘅事 
 But it won't wipe out, you know, all life on Earth, so that's fine. But it turns out, you don't need something six miles across to do a lot of damage. ||| 但係你知佢唔會毀滅所有地球上嘅生命 所以還好，不過好明顯 你唔想一個6英里長嘅嘢 飛來造成破壞 
 There is a median point between tiny rock and gigantic rock, and in fact, if any of you have ever been to near Winslow, Arizona, there is a crater in the desert there that is so iconic that it is actually called Meteor Crater. ||| 小岩石同大岩石之間有個中點 事實上你地去過 亞利桑那州嘅溫斯洛附近 嗰度有個坑係沙漠裡面 而且因為佢太典型，佢嘅名就變成流星坑 
 To give you a sense of scale, this is about a mile wide. ||| 爲了讓你地對晒士有個概念，呢個就有1英里寬 
 If you look up at the top, that's a parking lot, and those are recreational vehicles right there. ||| 如果你向上睇，嗰個就係一個停車場 嗰邊就係嗰啲旅遊車 
 So it's about a mile across, 600 feet deep. ||| 所以佢有1英里寬，600英尺深 
 The object that formed this was probably about 30 to 50 yards across, so roughly the size of Mackey Auditorium here. ||| 形成呢個小行星既物體大概係 30到50碼寬,所以差不多係 麥基禮堂嘅晒士 
 It came in at speeds that were tremendous, slammed into the ground, blew up, and exploded with the energy of roughly a 20-megaton nuclear bomb — a very hefty bomb. ||| 佢以巨大速度衝落來 衝到地下，跟住炸開 以近於一顆20原子彈嘅能量 爆炸 一個重磅炸彈 
 This was 50,000 years ago, so it may have wiped out a few buffalo or antelope, or something like that out in the desert, but it probably would not have caused global devastation. ||| 呢件事發生係5萬年前 所以令一些水牛或者羚羊消失 或者係生活係沙漠嘅動物 但佢不太可能 會造成全球嘅毀滅 
 It turns out that these things don't have to hit the ground to do a lot of damage. ||| 看來呢地嘢要造成大損傷 並不一定要落到地面 
 "Now, in 1908, over Siberia, near the Tunguska region — for those of you who are Dan Aykroyd fans and saw ""Ghostbusters,"" when he talked about the greatest cross-dimensional rift since the Siberia blast of 1909, where he got the date wrong, but that's okay. (Laughter) It was 1908. That's fine. I can live with that. (Laughter)" ||| "依家，係1908年，西伯利亞上空 靠近通古斯卡區域 對於係丹·艾克罗伊德FAN士同埋睇過""捉鬼特工隊""嘅人來講 當丹·艾克罗伊德講到1909年西伯利亞爆炸以來 最大嘅交叉維度裂縫 佢講錯咗日期，不過沒咩嘢影響。（笑） 其實事情發生係1908年,不過我可以接受佢嘅錯誤 (笑)" 
 Another rock came into the Earth's atmosphere and this one blew up above the ground, several miles up above the surface of the Earth. ||| 另一個岩石進入地球嘅大氣層 而且係空中爆炸 位於地面上方幾英里 
 The heat from the explosion set fire to the forest below it, and then the shock wave came down and knocked down trees for hundreds of square miles, okay? ||| 爆炸釋放出來嘅熱量 引起下方嘅森林大火 而且衝擊波將幾百平方英里嘅 樹推倒 
 This did a huge amount of damage. ||| 佢造成巨大嘅破壞 
 And again, this was a rock probably roughly the size of this auditorium that we're sitting in. ||| 又一次,呢個岩石係 差唔係我們依家坐嘅演講廳 
 In Meteor Crater it was made of metal, and metal is much tougher, so it made it to the ground. ||| 隕石由金屬構成 而且係好硬金屬 所以佢先可以落到地上 
 The one over Tunguska was probably made of rock, and that's much more crumbly, so it blew up in the air. Either way, these are tremendous explosions, 20 megatons. ||| 通古斯卡上空嘅石頭好可能係由岩石構成 更加易碎 所以佢會係空中爆炸 無論係邊一種方式,都引起2千萬噸嘅巨大爆炸 
 Now, when these things blow up, they're not going to do global ecological damage. ||| 當呢地嘢爆炸時 佢地唔會破壞全球生態 
 They're not going to do something like the dinosaur-killer did. ||| 佢地唔係 毀滅恐龍嘅那類嘢 
 They're just not big enough. ||| 佢地不夠大 
 But they will do global economic damage, because they don't have to hit, necessarily, to do this kind of damage. ||| 但係佢地係未來會破壞全球生態 因為佢地唔一定要撞擊 先可以造成呢類破壞 
 They don't have to do global devastation. ||| 佢地唔會令全球毀滅 
 If one of these things were to hit pretty much anywhere, it would cause a panic. ||| 如果任何一顆小行星求其撞向一個地方 就會引起恐慌 
 But if it came over a city, an important city — not that any city is more important than others, but some of them we depend on them more on the global economic basis — that could do a huge amount of damage to us as a civilization. ||| 但係如果佢撞到一個重要城市 並不是那種最重要嘅城市 而是更加依賴全球經濟嘅城市 對我地文明而言 就係一個 巨大破壞 
 So, now that I've scared the crap out of you ... ||| 我依家已經嚇到你連屎都出咗來 
 (Laughter) what can we do about this? All right? ||| (笑) 我地可以做啲咩嘢 
 This is a potential threat. ||| 呢個係一個潛在威脅 
 Let me note that we have not had a giant impact like the dinosaur-killer for 65 million years. They're very rare. ||| 讓我提醒一下 我地已經有65萬年 沒有經歷過毀滅恐龍嘅巨大能量.佢地係好罕見 
 The smaller ones happen more often, but probably on the order of a millennium, every few centuries or every few thousand years, but it's still something to be aware of. ||| 石頭越細，衝擊發生得就越多 但係好可能係以一千年為單位 每幾百年或者幾千年發生一次 但係我地都要小心啲佢先得 
 Well, what do we do about them? ||| 咁，我地要對佢地做啲乜嘢呢 
 The first thing we have to do is find them. ||| 第一件事係要搵到佢地 
 This is an image of an asteroid that passed us in 2009. ||| 呢係一個於2009年 經過我地嘅一顆小行星嘅圖片 
 It's right here. ||| 佢就係呢度 
 But you can see that it's extremely faint. ||| 但你地會發現佢係非常微小 
 I don't even know if you can see that in the back row. These are just stars. ||| 我都唔知坐係後邊那一排嘅你地是咪可以睇到佢 呢啲只是星星 
 This is a rock that was about 30 yards across, so roughly the size of the ones that blew up over Tunguska and hit Arizona 50,000 years ago. ||| 呢係一個30碼寬嘅岩石 差唔多同5萬年前 通古斯卡上空爆炸而且撞擊亞利桑那啲岩石一樣大 
 These things are faint. ||| 呢啲嘢好微小 
 They're hard to see, and the sky is really big. ||| 好難發現，而且天空實在太大 
 We have to find these things first. ||| 我地必須搵到佢地先 
 Well the good news is, we're looking for them. ||| 好消息係，我地已經搵緊佢地了 
 NASA has devoted money to this. ||| NASA出資做呢件事 
 The National Science Foundation, other countries are very interested in doing this. ||| 國家科學基金同埋其他國家 都對呢件事還有興趣 
 We're building telescopes that are looking for the threat. That's a great first step, but what's the second step? The second step is that we see one heading toward us, we have to stop it. What do we do? ||| 我地係製造緊可以發現威脅嘅太空望遠鏡 呢個係好大嘅一步 不過下一步又是咩嘢呢 第二步就係我地發現一顆小行星衝向地球時 我地要阻止佢。咁點做呢 
 You've probably heard about the asteroid Apophis. If you haven't yet, you will. ||| 你地好可能聽過小行星阿波菲斯 如果你冇，你地好快會聽到 
 If you've heard about the Mayan 2012 apocalypse, you're going to hear about Apophis, because you're keyed in to all the doomsday networks anyway. ||| 如果你聽過瑪雅2012預言 你就將會聽到小行星阿波菲斯 因為你地無論如何 都走唔脫世界末日 
 Apophis is an asteroid that was discovered in 2004. ||| 阿波菲斯小行星係2004年被發現 
 It's roughly 250 yards across, so it's pretty big — big size, you know, bigger than a football stadium — and it's going to pass by the Earth in April of 2029. ||| 佢差唔多有250碼寬 所以佢好大。你地知喇，係大晒士 仲大過足球場 而且佢將係2029年4月經過地球 
 And it's going to pass us so close that it's actually going to come underneath our weather satellites. ||| 佢靠得咁近 以至於佢幾乎會來到 氣象衛星下面 
 The Earth's gravity is going to bend the orbit of this thing so much that if it's just right, if it passes through this region of space, this kidney bean-shaped region called the keyhole, the Earth's gravity will bend it just enough that seven years later on April 13, which is a Friday, I'll note, in the year 2036 ... (Laughter) — you can't plan that kind of stuff — Apophis is going to hit us. And it's 250 meters across, so it would do unbelievable damage. ||| 如果佢正常運動 地球嘅重力將會扭曲佢嘅軌道 如果佢穿過一個區域空間 一個叫做鎖匙眼嘅豆角形狀區域 地球重力就會使其扭曲 恰恰七年以後 係4月13號，係一個星期五，提提你 係2036年...（笑） 你一定計唔到咁嘅事 阿波菲斯將會撞擊我地 而且佢有250米寬 所以將會造成巨大破壞 
 Now the good news is that the odds of it actually passing through this keyhole and hitting us next go-around are one in a million, roughly — very, very low odds, so I personally am not lying awake at night worrying about this at all. ||| 依家好消息係 佢穿過鎖匙眼，係下一個回合撞到我地嘅幾率 係百萬分之一 幾乎係非常非常之細嘅幾率 所以我自己唔會因為擔心佢而瞓唔著 
 I don't think Apophis is a problem. ||| 我唔認為阿波菲斯係一個問題 
 In fact, Apophis is a blessing in disguise, because it woke us up to the dangers of these things. ||| 事實上，塞翁失馬焉知非福 阿波菲斯帶俾我地 危險警示 
 This thing was discovered just a few years ago and could hit us a few years from now. ||| 呢個嘢係幾年前被發現 係幾年後可能會撞擊我地 
 It won't, but it gives us a chance to study these kinds of asteroids. We didn't really necessarily understand these keyholes, and now we do and it turns out that's really important, because how do you stop an asteroid like this? ||| 佢將來唔會俾，但佢依家俾咗我地一個機會 來研究呢類小行星 我地過去對鎖匙眼知之甚少 不過依家我地好清楚 而且瞭解清楚小行星係非常重要 因為你要點樣阻止呢類小行星呢 
 Well, let me ask you, what happens if you're standing in the middle of the road and a car's headed for you? What do you do? You do this. ||| 等我問你，如果你企係路上 突然有部車向你衝來，你會點做呢 你會點做？你會咁做 
 Right? Move. The car goes past you. ||| 係咪？移動。部車剛好同你擦身而過。 
 But we can't move the Earth, at least not easily, but we can move a small asteroid. ||| 但係我地不可以令地球移動 至少唔係冇咁易，但係我地可以令小行星移動。 
 And it turns out, we've even done it. ||| 而且睇來，我地甚至已經做好了 
 In the year 2005, NASA launched a probe called Deep Impact, which slammed into — slammed a piece of itself into the nucleus of a comet. ||| 2005年，NASA發射咗一個叫深層衝擊嘅探測器 撞到咗— 其中一部份撞入咗一顆彗星嘅核部 
 Comets are very much like asteroids. ||| 彗星好似小行星 
 The purpose wasn't to push it out of the way. ||| 目的唔係要將佢推到第二度 
 The purpose was to make a crater to excavate the material and see what was underneath the surface of this comet, which we learned quite a bit about. ||| 而且撞出一個坑來發掘 以瞭解彗星表面之下係咩嘢物質 我地由呢度 學到好多 
 We did move the comet a little tiny bit, not very much, but that wasn't the point. ||| 我地的確將小行星移動咗小小 雖然唔大，但唔緊要 
 However, think about this. ||| 不過，唸下呢個 
 This thing is orbiting the sun at 10 miles per second, 20 miles per second. ||| 呢個每秒圍繞太陽10英里， 每秒圍繞太陽20英里 
 We shot a space probe at it and hit it. Okay? ||| 我地發射咗一顆太空探測器而且擊中咗佢 
 Imagine how hard that must be, and we did it. ||| 唸下件事有幾難，但係我地做到咗 
 That means we can do it again. ||| 所以我們可以做多一次 
 If we need, if we see an asteroid that's coming toward us, and it's headed right for us, and we have two years to go, boom! We hit it. ||| 如果我地需要，如果我地睇來一顆小行星撞埋來 而且直直咁對住我地 而且我地有兩年時間，嘣！我地擊中咗佢！ 
 You can try to — you know, if you watch the movies, you might think about, why don't we use a nuclear weapon? ||| 你地可以試下。如果你地睇電影 你地可能會唸 點解我地不用原子彈 
 It's like, well, you can try that, but the problem is timing. ||| 好似你係可以試下，但是問題係時間 
 You shoot a nuclear weapon at this thing, you have to blow it up within a few milliseconds of tolerance or else you'll just miss it. ||| 如果你用原子彈來打佢 你要係幾百萬分之秒鐘引爆原子彈 如果唔係就打不中 
 And there are a lot of other problems with that. It's very hard to do. ||| 而且仲有好多其他問題 呢個好高難度 
 But just hitting something? That's pretty easy. ||| 如果只係要去撞呢？就易好多 
 I think even NASA can do that, and they proved that they can. (Laughter) The problem is, what happens if you hit this asteroid, you've changed the orbit, you measure the orbit and then you find out, oh, yeah, we just pushed it into a keyhole, and now it's going to hit us in three years. ||| 我唸NASA可以做到 佢地證明咗佢地可以。（笑） 問題係如果撞到小行星會點呢 因為你改變咗佢嘅軌道 測量佢嘅軌道然之後你地就會發現 喔，耶，我地將佢推入咗鎖匙眼 佢將會係三年之後撞擊我地 
 Well, my opinion is, fine. Okay? ||| 我嘅觀點係，唔緊要。 
 It's not hitting us in six months. That's good. ||| 佢唔會係6個月之內撞到我地，咁就好好了。 
 Now we have three years to do something else. ||| 依家我地有3年去做其他事情 
 And you can hit it again. That's kind of ham-fisted. You might just push it into a third keyhole or whatever, so you don't do that. ||| 你可以再次撞擊佢 呢係一件好蠢嘅事情 你會將佢撞入第三個鎖匙眼，所以你唔會咁做 
 And this is the part, it's the part I just love. ||| 呢個係我鍾意嘅部份 
 "(Laughter) After the big macho ""Rrrrrrr BAM! We're gonna hit this thing in the face,"" then we bring in the velvet gloves. (Laughter)" ||| （笑） 呢個威力十足嘅“嘣！ 我地將會迎面撞到呢個嘢”過後 我地就有咗天鵝絨手套 （笑） 
 "There's a group of scientists and engineers and astronauts and they call themselves The B612 Foundation. For those of you who've read ""The Little Prince,"" you understand that reference, I hope. The little prince who lived on an asteroid, it was called B612." ||| 有一群自稱為B612基金會 科學家，工程師 同埋太空人 對於讀過“小王子”嘅人 我希望你地明白那個指代 小王子住係一個叫做B612嘅小行星上 
 These are smart guys — men and women — astronauts, like I said, engineers. ||| 上邊有好多聰明人，有男有女 太空人，似我話齋，工程師 
 Rusty Schweickart, who was an Apollo 9 astronaut, is on this. Dan Durda, my friend who made this image, works here at Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, on Walnut Street. He created this image for this, and he's actually one of the astronomers who works for them. If we see an asteroid that's going to hit the Earth and we have enough time, we can hit it to move it into a better orbit. But then what we do is we launch a probe that has to weigh a ton or two. ||| 拉塞尔·施威卡特，曾是阿波羅9嘅太空人就係上面。 我朋友丹·德達製作咗呢幅影像 佢依家就係博爾德核桃街嘅 西南研究中心工作。 佢為呢個製作做一幅影像 而且佢事實上就是為佢地 工作太空人之一 如果我地發現咗一顆即將撞擊地球嘅小行星 而且有足夠嘅時間 我地可以將佢撞至一個更安全嘅軌道 但我地依家做緊嘅係發射一顆一至兩噸重嘅探測器 
 It doesn't have to be huge — couple of tons, not that big — and you park it near the asteroid. ||| 佢不一定要幾噸咁大 你只要將佢停係靠近小行星嘅地方 
 You don't land on it, because these things are tumbling end over end. It's very hard to land on them. ||| 你不需要登陸小行星 因為小行星來回震動，所以好難登陸 
 Instead you get near it. ||| 不如先靠近佢地 
 The gravity of the asteroid pulls on the probe, and the probe has a couple of tons of mass. ||| 小行星嘅重力會拉動探測器 而探測器又只有幾噸重 
 It has a little tiny bit of gravity, but it's enough that it can pull the asteroid, and you have your rockets set up, so you can — oh, you can barely see it here, but there's rocket plumes — and you basically, these guys are connected by their own gravity, and if you move the probe very slowly, very, very gently, you can very easily finesse that rock into a safe orbit. ||| 佢嘅重力太細， 但佢足以拉動小行星 再發射火箭，咁基本上就可以 噢，你幾乎可以係度睇到佢，但係那度有火箭羽焰 呢啲嘢嘅重力將佢地連接起來 如果你慢慢移動探測器 非常非常細力 你就可以好輕鬆咁將岩石送入一個安全軌道 
 You can even put in orbit around the Earth where we could mine it, although that's a whole other thing. I won't go into that. ||| 你甚至可以將佢送入圍繞地球嘅軌道,等我地摧毀佢 但係那個完全係另一件事 我唔會深入呢個話題 
 (Laughter) But we'd be rich! (Laughter) ||| （笑） 但係我地會成為有錢人 （笑） 
 So think about this, right? ||| 考慮下，好冇 
 There are these giant rocks flying out there, and they're hitting us, and they're doing damage to us, but we've figured out how to do this, and all the pieces are in place to do this. ||| 一些巨大岩石飛過 而且佢地會撞到我地，造成破壞 但係我地已經唸出點樣做呢件事 用手上嘅每一樣嘢來做 
 We have astronomers in place with telescopes looking for them. We have smart people, very, very smart people, who are concerned about this and figuring out how to fix the problem, and we have the technology to do this. ||| 我地已經有太空人埋位，用望遠鏡搵佢地 我地有聰明人 聰明到跌渣嘅人 佢地關心而且唸出咗點樣解決問題 而且我地有科技相助 
 This probe actually can't use chemical rockets. ||| 實際上呢個探測器唔可以使用化學火箭 
 Chemical rockets provide too much thrust, too much push. The probe would just shoot away. ||| 化學火箭嘅推力好大，大得濟。 探測器就打唔中 
 We invented something called an ion drive, which is a very, very, very low-thrust engine. ||| 我地發明咗叫做離子推動器嘅嘢 佢係一個推力非常細嘅引擎 
 It generates the force a piece of paper would have on your hand, incredibly light, but it can run for months and years, providing that very gentle push. ||| 佢產生嘅推力十分之細 相當於一張擺係手上嘅紙產生嘅力 但係佢可以連續幾個月到幾年 提供輕微嘅推力 
 "If anybody here is a fan of the original ""Star Trek,"" they ran across an alien ship that had an ion drive, and Spock said, ""They're very technically sophisticated." ||| 如果呢讀有人係“星際旅行”原始系列嘅FAN士 佢地揸住一部有離子推動器嘅外星飛船 而且斯波克話 “佢地有精密嘅科技 
 "They're a hundred years ahead of us with this drive."" Yeah, we have an ion drive now. (Laughter) We don't have the Enterprise, but we've got an ion drive now." ||| 憑住呢個推動器，佢地領先我地100年。“ 耶，我地依家都有咗離子推動器。（笑） 我地冇企業號 但係我地已經有離子推動器 
 (Applause) Spock. ||| （掌聲） 斯波克 
 (Laughter) So ... ||| （笑） 所以... 
 that's the difference, that's the difference between us and the dinosaurs. ||| 呢個就是差別 就係我地同恐龍嘅差別 
 This happened to them. ||| 佢地會滅亡 
 It doesn't have to happen to us. ||| 但我地唔一定 
 The difference between the dinosaurs and us is that we have a space program and we can vote, and so we can change our future. ||| 我地同恐龍嘅差別在於 我地有太空計劃 而且我地可以投票 所以我地可以改變未來 
 (Laughter) We have the ability to change our future. ||| （笑） 我地有能力去改變未來 
 65 million years from now, we don't have to have our bones collecting dust in a museum. ||| 6千5百萬年後 我們嘅骨頭唔會 係博物館裡面惹塵埃 
 Thank you very much. ||| 多謝晒 
 (Applause) ||| （掌聲） 
 I write about food. I write about cooking. ||| 我寫有關食物同煮嘢嘅文章 
 I take it quite seriously, but I'm here to talk about something that's become very important to me in the last year or two. ||| 我對呢件事好認真 但我響度想講一啲 呢兩年嚟對我嚟講好重要嘅嘢 
 It is about food, but it's not about cooking, per se. ||| 呢樣嘢係有關食物嘅，但唔係講煮食本身 
 I'm going to start with this picture of a beautiful cow. ||| 我先用一張好靚嘅母牛相做開場白 
 I'm not a vegetarian — this is the old Nixon line, right? ||| 我唔係素食者…尼克遜成日都講呢句，係咪呀？ 
 But I still think that this — (Laughter) — may be this year's version of this. ||| 但我就覺得 (觀眾笑) 呢張可能係今年嘅版本 
 Now, that is only a little bit hyperbolic. ||| 咁講只係有少少誇張啫 
 And why do I say it? ||| 點解我咁講？ 
 Because only once before has the fate of individual people and the fate of all of humanity been so intertwined. ||| 因為史上系依樣野之前只有一次，個人嘅命運 同全人類嘅命運 有咁緊密相連過 
 There was the bomb, and there's now. ||| 以前係原子彈，而依家就係呢一刻 
 And where we go from here is going to determine not only the quality and the length of our individual lives, but whether, if we could see the Earth a century from now, we'd recognize it. ||| 而我哋依家行嘅路唔單止決定 個人生命嘅質素同長短 仲決定一個世紀以後 我哋望返地球嗰陣，仲會唔會認得出佢 
 It's a holocaust of a different kind, and hiding under our desks isn't going to help. ||| 呢次某程度係一個大屠殺 而逃避並唔係辦法 
 Start with the notion that global warming is not only real, but dangerous. ||| 我哋開始知道全球暖化 唔單止係真嘅，而且仲好危險 
 Since every scientist in the world now believes this, and even President Bush has seen the light, or pretends to, we can take this is a given. ||| 依家個個科學家都相信有全球暖化 就算布殊總統都話佢明白依個事實，又或者佢系扮明白 呢啲嘢可以係前提 
 Then hear this, please. ||| 咁大家請聽住 
 After energy production, livestock is the second-highest contributor to atmosphere-altering gases. ||| 家畜係繼能源生產之後 第二大導致大氣層變化嘅氣體嘅生產者 
 Nearly one-fifth of all greenhouse gas is generated by livestock production — more than transportation. ||| 近五分一嘅溫室氣體 係由畜牧產生 占嘅比重仲大過交通工具 
 Now, you can make all the jokes you want about cow farts, but methane is 20 times more poisonous than CO2, and it's not just methane. ||| 任你想點用牛放屁嚟講笑都得 問題係甲烷比二氧化碳有毒二十倍 而且佢哋製造嘅唔止甲烷 
 Livestock is also one of the biggest culprits in land degradation, air and water pollution, water shortages and loss of biodiversity. ||| 生畜仲係土地退化，空氣、食水污染 食水短缺同生物多樣性降低嘅促成者 
 There's more. ||| 仲有 
 Like half the antibiotics in this country are not administered to people, but to animals. ||| 全國有一半嘅抗生素 唔係用響人度，係用咗響禽畜度 
 But lists like this become kind of numbing, so let me just say this: if you're a progressive, if you're driving a Prius, or you're shopping green, or you're looking for organic, you should probably be a semi-vegetarian. ||| 但呢啲清單聽得多會麻木，我只係想話 如果你走在時代尖端 如果你揸緊環保車，或者支持綠色消費 又或者你搵緊有機食物嚟食 咁你都應該係半素食嘅 
 Now, I'm no more anti-cattle than I am anti-atom, but it's all in the way we use these things. ||| 係，我反對食牛肉，好似反原子彈咁樣 但我反對嘅係我哋人類用呢啲嘢嘅方式 
 There's another piece of the puzzle, which Ann Cooper talked about beautifully yesterday, and one you already know. ||| 你地都應該已經知道既 安古柏響尋日精彩嘅演講講到 呢個現象嘅其中一個構成部份 
 There's no question, none, that so-called lifestyle diseases — diabetes, heart disease, stroke, some cancers — are diseases that are far more prevalent here than anywhere in the rest of the world. ||| 無容置疑，諗都唔駛諗，啲所謂都市病 好似糖尿病，心臟病，中風，某啲癌症 呢啲病響呢度 都比世界其他地方普遍 
 And that's the direct result of eating a Western diet. ||| 呢啲病係西方飲食嘅直接結果 
 Our demand for meat, dairy and refined carbohydrates — the world consumes one billion cans or bottles of Coke a day — our demand for these things, not our need, our want, drives us to consume way more calories than are good for us. ||| 我哋追求肉、奶製品、精製過嘅碳水化合物 全世界一日飲咗以億樽計嘅可樂 我哋對呢啲嘢嘅需求，唔係必需嘅，只係慾望 令我哋食咗太多卡路里 
 And those calories are in foods that cause, not prevent, disease. ||| 而呢啲卡路里唔會防止疾病，仲反而引起病痛 
 Now global warming was unforeseen. ||| 無人預計到有全球暖化 
 We didn't know that pollution did more than cause bad visibility. ||| 我哋唔知污染原來唔止令能見度差咗咁簡單 
 Maybe a few lung diseases here and there, but, you know, that's not such a big deal. ||| 仲可能令人有一啲肺部嘅疾病 但你知道，呢啲都唔係咩大不了 
 The current health crisis, however, is a little more the work of the evil empire. ||| 重要係，依家嘅健康危機 比阻止邪惡帝國更加棘手 
 We were told, we were assured, that the more meat and dairy and poultry we ate, the healthier we'd be. ||| 人哋同我哋講，向我哋保證 家畜、奶製品、家禽食得越多 我哋就會越健康 
 No. Overconsumption of animals, and of course, junk food, is the problem, along with our paltry consumption of plants. ||| 錯。唔駛講，過量攝取肉類同垃圾食物 而蔬果食得少之有少係個問題 
 Now, there's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here, but the evidence is that plants — and I want to make this clear — it's not the ingredients in plants, it's the plants. ||| 今次無時間講食蔬果有乜好處 但我想講清楚，最重要係蔬菜本身 唔係蔬菜入面嘅成份，係菜本身 
 It's not the beta-carotene, it's the carrot. ||| 唔係B-胡蘿蔔素，係紅蘿蔔本身重要 
 The evidence is very clear that plants promote health. ||| 證據好清楚咁顯示蔬菜促進健康 
 This evidence is overwhelming at this point. ||| 響呢方面嘅證據係不可置疑 
 You eat more plants, you eat less other stuff, you live longer. ||| 食多啲蔬果，食少啲其他嘢，你就長命啲 
 Not bad. ||| 聽落唔錯丫 
 But back to animals and junk food. ||| 講返肉食同垃圾食品 
 What do they have in common? ||| 佢地有乜共通點？ 
 One: we don't need either of them for health. ||| 第一，我哋唔駛為咗健康而食呢啲嘢 
 We don't need animal products, and we certainly don't need white bread or Coke. ||| 我哋唔需要肉類製品 當然我哋亦唔需要白麵包同可樂 
 Two: both have been marketed heavily, creating unnatural demand. ||| 第二，呢兩樣嘢都做好多推廣 製造唔自然嘅需求 
 We're not born craving Whoppers or Skittles. ||| 我哋唔係生出嚟就淨食三文治或者彩虹糖 
 Three: their production has been supported by government agencies at the expense of a more health- and Earth-friendly diet. ||| 第三，呢啲食物嘅生產有政府機構支持 而且代價系取代左一種更健康、更環保嘅飲食方式 
 Now, let's imagine a parallel. ||| 我哋一齊幻想下有對平行線 
 Let's pretend that our government supported an oil-based economy, while discouraging more sustainable forms of energy, knowing all the while that the result would be pollution, war and rising costs. ||| 假設政府支持以石油經濟 又唔支持可持續發展嘅能源種類 而且佢知道後果會係 污染、戰爭、成本上升 
 Incredible, isn't it? ||| 不可思議呀呵？ 
 Yet they do that. ||| 但佢地係要咁做 
 And they do this here. It's the same deal. ||| 佢哋就響度做呢啲嘢，係一樣㗎咋 
 The sad thing is, when it comes to diet, is that even when well-intentioned Feds try to do right by us, they fail. ||| 可惜嘅係，講到飲食習慣 就算聯邦政府好心地咁 想為我哋撥亂反正，都衰咗 
 Either they're outvoted by puppets of agribusiness, or they are puppets of agribusiness. ||| 一係佢哋投票輸咗畀農業企業嘅傀儡 又或者佢哋就係農業企業嘅傀儡 
 So, when the USDA finally acknowledged that it was plants, rather than animals, that made people healthy, they encouraged us, via their overly simplistic food pyramid, to eat five servings of fruits and vegetables a day, along with more carbs. ||| 所以當美國農業部最終承認 蔬果而唔係肉類令人健康之後 佢哋用過份簡化嘅食物金字塔去鼓勵我哋 每日食五份蔬果 同埋食多啲碳水化合物 
 What they didn't tell us is that some carbs are better than others, and that plants and whole grains should be supplanting eating junk food. ||| 佢哋無講嘅係有啲碳水化合物係好啲 而蔬果同全穀食物 應該取代晒垃圾食物 
 But industry lobbyists would never let that happen. ||| 但業界嘅說客又點會畀呢啲嘢發生 
 And guess what? ||| 你估下實情係點？ 
 Half the people who developed the food pyramid have ties to agribusiness. ||| 諗呢個食物金字塔嘅人入面有一半 同農業企業有關係 
 So, instead of substituting plants for animals, our swollen appetites simply became larger, and the most dangerous aspects of them remained unchanged. ||| 所以蔬菜唔單指無取代到肉 我哋吃肉嘅胃口反而越變越大 而當中對身體最危險嘅影響仍然無變 
 So-called low-fat diets, so-called low-carb diets — these are not solutions. ||| 嗰啲所謂低脂飲食、低澱粉質飲食 都唔係解決方法 
 But with lots of intelligent people focusing on whether food is organic or local, or whether we're being nice to animals, the most important issues just aren't being addressed. ||| 但好多聰明人 只著眼啲食物係咪有機或者本地嘅 或者係咪善待啲動物 但最重要嘅問題就無觸及到 
 Now, don't get me wrong. ||| 唔好誤會 
 I like animals, and I don't think it's just fine to industrialize their production and to churn them out like they were wrenches. ||| 我好鍾意動物 我唔認同將佢哋嘅生產過程工業化 粗製濫造啲肉類出嚟 
 But there's no way to treat animals well, when you're killing 10 billion of them a year. ||| 但當你一年殺成百億動物嗰陣 就無辦法講點善待啲動物 
 That's our number. 10 billion. ||| 呢個係我哋呢度嘅數字，一百億 
 If you strung all of them — chickens, cows, pigs and lambs — to the moon, they'd go there and back five times, there and back. ||| 如果將啲雞呀、牛呀、豬呀、羊呀 動物排成一列去月球 條隊由呢度到月球可以來回五次 
 Now, my math's a little shaky, but this is pretty good, and it depends whether a pig is four feet long or five feet long, but you get the idea. ||| 我啲數學麻麻地，但系計依嘀都仲系夠用既 仲要視乎隻豬係四呎定五呎長 不過你明啦 
 That's just the United States. ||| 呢個數淨係計美國入面咋喎 
 And with our hyper-consumption of those animals producing greenhouse gases and heart disease, kindness might just be a bit of a red herring. ||| 我哋過度食用呢啲肉類 產生咁多溫室氣體，引起咁多心臟疾病 呢啲慈悲似乎只係用嚟轉移視線 
 Let's get the numbers of the animals we're killing for eating down, and then we'll worry about being nice to the ones that are left. ||| 我哋殺咗啲動物，食咗佢哋 然後諗下要點樣對剩低嘅動物好啲 
 "Another red herring might be exemplified by the word ""locavore,"" which was just named word of the year by the New Oxford American Dictionary." ||| 另一個煙幕可以用「土食主義者」做例子 呢個詞啱啱畀新牛津美語大辭典稱為本年度嘅風雲詞彙 
 Seriously. ||| 講真㗎 
 And locavore, for those of you who don't know, is someone who eats only locally grown food — which is fine if you live in California, but for the rest of us it's a bit of a sad joke. ||| 土食主義者就係 一啲只食本土種植嘅食品嘅人 如果你住加州就無問題 但其他人嚟講就難度好高 
 Between the official story — the food pyramid — and the hip locavore vision, you have two versions of how to improve our eating. ||| 響正統嘅食物金字塔 同時興嘅土食主義之間 大家有兩款版本點去食好啲 
 (Laughter). ||| (笑) 
 They both get it wrong, though. ||| 但雙方都諗錯方向 
 The first at least is populist, and the second is elitist. ||| 第一款至少都想普及一啲，而第二款直頭係精英主義 
 How we got to this place is the history of food in the United States. ||| 我哋變成咁樣，就要由美國食物史講起 
 And I'm going to go through that, at least the last hundred years or so, very quickly right now. ||| 而我依家帶你哋 好快咁睇下過去一百年係點 
 A hundred years ago, guess what? ||| 一百年前係點樣？ 
 Everyone was a locavore: even New York had pig farms nearby, and shipping food all over the place was a ridiculous notion. ||| 個個都係食本地生產嘅食物 運啲食物去第二度簡直妙想天開 
 Every family had a cook, usually a mom. ||| 每個屋企都有廚師，多數係由阿媽做埋 
 And those moms bought and prepared food. ||| 佢地買材料同煮嘢食 
 It was like your romantic vision of Europe. ||| 就好似你哋幻想中浪漫嘅歐洲咁樣 
 Margarine didn't exist. ||| 人造牛油未出現 
 In fact, when margarine was invented, several states passed laws declaring that it had to be dyed pink, so we'd all know that it was a fake. ||| 其實人造牛油面世時 有幾個州份都通過話要佢哋染成粉紅色 等啲人知呢啲唔係真牛油 
 There was no snack food, and until the '20s, until Clarence Birdseye came along, there was no frozen food. ||| 嗰陣都未有零食，到二十年代 發明家貝爾塞發明急凍技術，至有急凍食品 
 There were no restaurant chains. ||| 嗰陣無連鎖餐廳 
 There were neighborhood restaurants run by local people, but none of them would think to open another one. ||| 得一嗰由本地人開畀鄰居嘅食肆 無人諗住要開多間分店 
 Eating ethnic was unheard of unless you were ethnic. ||| 傳統飲食係聞所未聞，除非你本身係小數民族啦 
 And fancy food was entirely French. ||| 啲花巧食物全部都係嚟自法國 
 As an aside, those of you who remember Dan Aykroyd in the 1970s doing Julia Child imitations can see where he got the idea of stabbing himself from this fabulous slide. ||| 講開又講，如果你記得七十年代 丹‧艾克洛德扮茱莉亞‧查爾德嘅話 睇到呢張圖你就知點解佢有咁嘅諗頭 
 (Laughter) Back in those days, before even Julia, back in those days, there was no philosophy of food. ||| (笑) 響茱莉亞出名之前 嗰陣都無乜人提倡飲食文化 
 You just ate. ||| 食嘢就係食嘢 
 You didn't claim to be anything. ||| 唔駛提倡啲乜嘢主義 
 There was no marketing. There were no national brands. ||| 嗰陣無市場推廣，無全國性品牌 
 Vitamins had not been invented. ||| 維他命丸都未有 
 There were no health claims, at least not federally sanctioned ones. ||| 亦都無健康宣稱，連聯邦法例批准嘅都無 
 Fats, carbs, proteins — they weren't bad or good, they were food. ||| 脂肪、澱粉質、蛋白質，都無分好壞，佢哋只係食物 
 You ate food. ||| 你就只係食食物 
 Hardly anything contained more than one ingredient, because it was an ingredient. ||| 好多時啲嘢食好少多過一個材料 因為佢哋本身就係材料 
 The cornflake hadn't been invented. ||| 嗰陣未發明粟米片 
 (Laughter) The Pop-Tart, the Pringle, Cheez Whiz, none of that stuff. ||| (笑) 甜夾心餅、薯片、芝士醬，呢啲嘢都未有 
 Goldfish swam. ||| 當時金魚係游水（註：不是金魚餅） 
 (Laughter) It's hard to imagine. People grew food, and they ate food. ||| (笑) 好難想像。嗰陣自己種嘢食，然後食種出嚟嘅嘢食 
 And again, everyone ate local. ||| 講多一次，佢哋食本地出產嘅食物 
 In New York, an orange was a common Christmas present, because it came all the way from Florida. ||| 響紐約，聖誕節送橙好普遍 因為橙要由佛羅里達州運嚟 
 From the '30s on, road systems expanded, trucks took the place of railroads, fresh food began to travel more. ||| 三十年代起，道路系統擴展 貨車取代鐵路 新鮮食物開始越運越遠 
 Oranges became common in New York. ||| 橙響紐約變得唾手可得 
 The South and West became agricultural hubs, and in other parts of the country, suburbs took over farmland. ||| 南部同西部成為農業重鎮 其他地方嘅農地變成近郊 
 The effects of this are well known. They are everywhere. ||| 帶嚟嘅影響深遠，到處可見 
 And the death of family farms is part of this puzzle, as is almost everything from the demise of the real community to the challenge of finding a good tomato, even in summer. ||| 家庭式農場嘅消失是其中一環 就好似從真正社區沒落 到夏天都難搵一個靚蕃茄咁 都係影響嘅一部份 
 Eventually, California produced too much food to ship fresh, so it became critical to market canned and frozen foods. ||| 最後加州出產太多食物，運都運唔晒 所以推廣罐頭和急凍食品在所必行 
 Thus arrived convenience. ||| 於是用方便嚟做賣點 
 It was sold to proto-feminist housewives as a way to cut down on housework. ||| 呢啲食物以原女性主義嘅主婦作對象 等佢哋做少啲家務 
 Now, I know everybody over the age of, like 45 — their mouths are watering at this point. ||| 我知道過咗大約四十五歲嘅觀眾 見到實流晒口水 
 (Laughter) (Applause) If we had a slide of Salisbury steak, even more so, right? (Laughter) ||| (笑) (掌聲) 如果有幅漢堡扒嘅圖片，你哋流多啲口水添，係咪？ (笑) 
 But this may have cut down on housework, but it cut down on the variety of food we ate as well. ||| 雖然咁樣會做少咗家務 但亦會減少左我哋食嘅食物嘅種類 
 Many of us grew up never eating a fresh vegetable except the occasional raw carrot or maybe an odd lettuce salad. ||| 我地好多人成長嗰陣除咗有時食下生紅蘿蔔 或者生菜沙律之外，好少會食新鮮蔬果 
 I, for one — and I'm not kidding — didn't eat real spinach or broccoli till I was 19. ||| 以我為例，唔係講笑 到十九歲至食到真嘅菠菜同西蘭花 
 Who needed it though? Meat was everywhere. ||| 邊個需要食呢啲嘢呢？周圍都有肉食 
 What could be easier, more filling or healthier for your family than broiling a steak? ||| 有啲乜野比煎塊扒畀屋企人食更加 容易，飽肚、或健康？ 
 But by then cattle were already raised unnaturally. ||| 嗰陣啲牛已經唔係用天然方法飼養 
 Rather than spending their lives eating grass, for which their stomachs were designed, they were forced to eat soy and corn. ||| 牛嘅胃系設計嚟食草既 但啲人硬系要迫佢食大豆同粟米 都唔由得佢食草 
 They have trouble digesting those grains, of course, but that wasn't a problem for producers. ||| 啲牛當然消化唔到啲穀物 但呢啲唔係生產者嘅間題 
 New drugs kept them healthy. ||| 新嘅葯物會維持佢哋健康 
 Well, they kept them alive. ||| 應該話會令佢哋繼續生存 
 Healthy was another story. ||| 健唔健康係另一回事 
 Thanks to farm subsidies, the fine collaboration between agribusiness and Congress, soy, corn and cattle became king. ||| 多得農業補貼 呢啲農業企業同國會嘅微妙合作方式 大豆、粟米、牛隻大行其道 
 And chicken soon joined them on the throne. ||| 之後雞都加埋入去添 
 It was during this period that the cycle of dietary and planetary destruction began, the thing we're only realizing just now. ||| 呢個時期就係 飲食同地球毀滅嘅循環開端 呢樣嘢到依家我哋至意識到 
 Listen to this, between 1950 and 2000, the world's population doubled. ||| 聽清楚 一九五零年至二千年之間，全球人口增加一倍 
 Meat consumption increased five-fold. ||| 但系肉食攝取就增加五倍 
 Now, someone had to eat all that stuff, so we got fast food. ||| 咁實有啲人食咗多出黎既肉，所以我哋有左快餐 
 And this took care of the situation resoundingly. ||| 咁就徹底解釋咗呢個問題 
 Home cooking remained the norm, but its quality was down the tubes. ||| 響屋企煮嘢食都仲係普遍，但質素已經每況愈下 
 There were fewer meals with home-cooked breads, desserts and soups, because all of them could be bought at any store. ||| 越來越少有屋企整嘅麵包、甜品同湯 因為全部呢啲嘢都可以響舖頭買到 
 Not that they were any good, but they were there. ||| 唔係話買返嚟質素好啲，只不過係買就有得吃 
 Most moms cooked like mine: a piece of broiled meat, a quickly made salad with bottled dressing, canned soup, canned fruit salad. ||| 大部份媽咪好似我阿媽咁煮飯 一塊烤肉，用樽裝沙律醬撈成嘅沙律 罐頭湯，罐頭生果沙律 
 Maybe baked or mashed potatoes, or perhaps the stupidest food ever, Minute Rice. ||| 可能有焗薯同薯蓉 又或者食史上最唔駛用腦嘅食物：即食飯 
 For dessert, store-bought ice cream or cookies. ||| 甜品就係響出面買嘅雪糕或者曲奇餅 
 My mom is not here, so I can say this now. ||| 我阿媽唔在場，我可以講你知 
 This kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself. ||| 因為呢啲咁嘅廚藝驅使我去學煮嘢食畀自己 
 (Laughter) It wasn't all bad. ||| (笑) 都唔一定係壞事嚟嘅 
 By the '70s, forward-thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients. ||| 七十年代，思想先進嘅人 開始意識到本地食材嘅價值 
 We tended gardens, we became interested in organic food, we knew or we were vegetarians. ||| 於是自己整個花園，對有機食品有興趣 我哋認識或者成為素食人士 
 We weren't all hippies, either. ||| 我哋唔係做咗嬉皮士 
 Some of us were eating in good restaurants and learning how to cook well. ||| 有啲人仲仍然去幫襯好餐廳，學下點煮好餸 
 Meanwhile, food production had become industrial. Industrial. ||| 同時食物嘅生產過程變得工業化，叫工業化 
 Perhaps because it was being produced rationally, as if it were plastic, food gained magical or poisonous powers, or both. ||| 可能因為畀人認為可以好似 塑膠咁系生產線到啤出嚟 食物獲得神奇或者有害嘅力量，甚至兩者都有 
 Many people became fat-phobic. ||| 好多人對肥胖有恐懼 
 Others worshiped broccoli, as if it were God-like. ||| 另一啲人當西蘭花係神咁拜 
 But mostly they didn't eat broccoli. ||| 但好多時佢哋都唔食西蘭花 
 Instead they were sold on yogurt, yogurt being almost as good as broccoli. ||| 取而代之，西蘭花就連埋乳酪咁一齊賣 乳酪好似同西蘭花咁好 
 Except, in reality, the way the industry sold yogurt was to convert it to something much more akin to ice cream. ||| 而事實上，業界銷售乳酪嗰陣 係將孔酪變到好似雪糕咁 
 Similarly, let's look at a granola bar. ||| 同樣，睇下啲穀類果仁棒球場 
 You think that that might be healthy food, but in fact, if you look at the ingredient list, it's closer in form to a Snickers than it is to oatmeal. ||| 以為呢啲嘢食會健康啲 但你睇返原料表 原來佢似朱古力棒多過以燕麥 
 Sadly, it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma, if not actually killed — the beginning of the heyday of value-added food, which contained as many soy and corn products as could be crammed into it. ||| 好可惜，呢個時候家庭式晚餐就算唔係一命嗚呼 都已經進入昏迷狀態 嗰啲可以塞幾多就塞幾多大豆同粟米製品 嘅增值食品 開始繁盛起嚟 
 Think of the frozen chicken nugget. ||| 睇下啲急凍雞塊 
 The chicken is fed corn, and then its meat is ground up, and mixed with more corn products to add bulk and binder, and then it's fried in corn oil. ||| 啲雞係用粟米餵大，啲肉同粟米製品 攪埋一齊，等佢大舊啲同黏得埋一齊 然後放入粟米油度炸 
 All you do is nuke it. What could be better? ||| 你只需要放入微波爐叮，有乜好過咁？ 
 And zapped horribly, pathetically. ||| 然後狼吞虎嚥咁食落肚 
 By the '70s, home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of foods like McNuggets and Hot Pockets — and we all have our favorites, actually — made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were serving at home. ||| 到七十年代，響屋企煮嘢食呢樣嘢己經到咗慘不忍睹嘅地步 一啲好似麥樂雞同叮叮食物 咁嘅高脂多調味料嘅食品 仲有其他我哋鍾意食嘅嘢 相比之下，起自家煮嘅 淡而無味嘅嘢食，呢類食物吸引人得多 
 At the same time, masses of women were entering the workforce, and cooking simply wasn't important enough for men to share the burden. ||| 同時，大量女性投入勞動市場 男人唔覺得煮嘢食重要到 要渠去做呢樣野 
 So now, you've got your pizza nights, you've got your microwave nights, you've got your grazing nights, you've got your fend-for-yourself nights and so on. ||| 於是我哋依家薄餅就當一餐，微波爐叮嘢食當一餐 放任咁想吃就吃又系一餐， 自己照顧自己都系一餐，諸如此類 
 Leading the way — what's leading the way? ||| 乜嘢食物獨當一面？ 
 Meat, junk food, cheese: the very stuff that will kill you. ||| 肉類，垃圾食物，芝士 呢啲嘢食都會拿你命 
 So, now we clamor for organic food. ||| 依家我哋大大聲要有機食品 
 That's good. ||| 係好事嚟嘅 
 And as evidence that things can actually change, you can now find organic food in supermarkets, and even in fast-food outlets. ||| 證明啲事情其實會改變 依家響超市 甚至響快餐店都搵到有機食物 
 But organic food isn't the answer either, at least not the way it's currently defined. ||| 但有機食物都唔係答案 至少唔係好似依家咁界定有機 
 Let me pose you a question. ||| 我問下你哋 
 Can farm-raised salmon be organic, when its feed has nothing to do with its natural diet, even if the feed itself is supposedly organic, and the fish themselves are packed tightly in pens, swimming in their own filth? ||| 啲三文魚食嘅係有機，但同天然飲食無關嘅飼料 又畀人養響窄窄嘅圍入面 響自己啲污糟嘢入面游水 呢啲養殖三文魚可以叫有機嗎？ 
 And if that salmon's from Chile, and it's killed down there and then flown 5,000 miles, whatever, dumping how much carbon into the atmosphere? ||| 又如果啲三文魚來自智利，響嗰度劏 然後運去五千哩外，釋放唔知幾多碳入大氣層 呢啲又點算有機？ 
 I don't know. ||| 我唔知道 
 Packed in Styrofoam, of course, before landing somewhere in the United States, and then being trucked a few hundred more miles. ||| 當然呢啲魚運到美國前 用發泡膠包住 然後再用貨車運去幾百哩外 
 This may be organic in letter, but it's surely not organic in spirit. ||| 字面係有機，但精神上當然唔係有機 
 Now here is where we all meet. ||| 呢個就係各類人意見嘅交點 
 The locavores, the organivores, the vegetarians, the vegans, the gourmets and those of us who are just plain interested in good food. ||| 土食主義者，有機主義者，素食者 純素食者，美食家 仲有一啲純粹對好嘢食有興趣嘅人 
 Even though we've come to this from different points, we all have to act on our knowledge to change the way that everyone thinks about food. ||| 雖然我哋出發點唔同 我哋全部要用自己知識 去改變他人對食物嘅諗法 
 We need to start acting. ||| 我哋要開始行動 
 And this is not only an issue of social justice, as Ann Cooper said — and, of course, she's completely right — but it's also one of global survival. ||| 而且好以安古柏咁講，呢個唔單止關乎社會公義 而且佢講得啱 呢個亦關乎全球嘅存亡 
 Which bring me full circle and points directly to the core issue, the overproduction and overconsumption of meat and junk food. ||| 呢點帶到我去核心問題度 就係過度生產食物，過度攝取肉類同垃圾食物 
 As I said, 18 percent of greenhouse gases are attributed to livestock production. ||| 我講過，百分之十八嘅溫室氣體 來自家畜 
 How much livestock do you need to produce this? ||| 我哋要幾多家畜至製造到咁多氣體？ 
 70 percent of the agricultural land on Earth, 30 percent of the Earth's land surface is directly or indirectly devoted to raising the animals we'll eat. ||| 要用全球農業用地嘅七成 而地球三成陸地直接或間接咁 用咗黎養我哋食嘅生畜 
 And this amount is predicted to double in the next 40 years or so. ||| 預計四十年後仲要用多一倍地 
 And if the numbers coming in from China are anything like what they look like now, it's not going to be 40 years. ||| 如果個數目係來自中國 而中國好似依家咁 唔駛四十年添 
 There is no good reason for eating as much meat as we do. ||| 我想講，好似我咁成世人食唔少穀飼牛肉 
 And I say this as a man who has eaten a fair share of corned beef in his life. ||| 其實無乜原因要好似我地咁食咁多肉 
 The most common argument is that we need nutrients — even though we eat, on average, twice as much protein as even the industry-obsessed USDA recommends. ||| 常見嘅論點係我哋需要營養 但其實我哋平均食落肚嘅蛋白質 甚至係偏幫企業嘅農業部所建議嘅兩倍 
 But listen: experts who are serious about disease reduction recommend that adults eat just over half a pound of meat per week. ||| 留心聽住，研究減少疾病嘅專家 建議成人每個禮拜只係食半磅肉 
 What do you think we eat per day? Half a pound. ||| 你估我哋一日食幾多肉？半磅 
 But don't we need meat to be big and strong? ||| 但我哋唔駛食肉就可以大隻啲，強壯啲咩？ 
 Isn't meat eating essential to health? ||| 乜食肉唔係健康必需嘅咩？ 
 Won't a diet heavy in fruit and vegetables turn us into godless, sissy, liberals? ||| 乜食得生果蔬菜多 唔會搞到我地變得邪惡、女人型、變成自由黨人咩？ 
 (Laughter) Some of us might think that would be a good thing. ||| (笑) 有啲人可能覺得食肉係好事 
 But, no, even if we were all steroid-filled football players, the answer is no. ||| 但就算我哋全部都係食咗類固醇嘅足球員 答案仍然係錯 
 In fact, there's no diet on Earth that meets basic nutritional needs that won't promote growth, and many will make you much healthier than ours does. ||| 其實，世界上無一種飲食方式 滿足到基本營養需要而唔促進健康 好多飲食方式比我哋依家嘅都更能令人健康 
 We don't eat animal products for sufficient nutrition, we eat them to have an odd form of malnutrition, and it's killing us. ||| 我哋食肉唔係為咗充足嘅營養 反而令我哋有另類嘅營養不足，係致命嘅 
 To suggest that in the interests of personal and human health Americans eat 50 percent less meat — it's not enough of a cut, but it's a start. ||| 想為個人、人類嘅健康著想 建議美國人食少一半肉 減少呢個份量不足以起作用，但起碼係個開始 
 It would seem absurd, but that's exactly what should happen, and what progressive people, forward-thinking people should be doing and advocating, along with the corresponding increase in the consumption of plants. ||| 聽起上嚟好古怪，但除咗叫人食相對多返嘅蔬菜 但呢啲至係應該發生嘅 係思想先進嘅人，改革派嘅人 應該做，應該提倡嘅 
 I've been writing about food more or less omnivorously — one might say indiscriminately — for about 30 years. ||| 我用雜食人士角度，或者有人話係不加批判咁 寫咗有關食物嘅文章差唔多卅年 
 During that time, I've eaten and recommended eating just about everything. ||| 響嗰段時間，我食咗 又推薦咗差唔多所有嘢食 
 I'll never stop eating animals, I'm sure, but I do think that for the benefit of everyone, the time has come to stop raising them industrially and stop eating them thoughtlessly. ||| 我知道我唔會唔食肉 但我認為，為咗所有人嘅福祉 係時候唔好再用工業化方式飼養動物 唔好再無諗過就食肉 
 Ann Cooper's right. ||| 安古柏講得啱 
 The USDA is not our ally here. ||| 農業部唔係我地盟友 
 We have to take matters into our own hands, not only by advocating for a better diet for everyone — and that's the hard part — but by improving our own. ||| 我哋要落手落腳去做 唔單止為其他人支持好啲嘅飲食方式 困難嘅係要改善自己嘅飲食 
 And that happens to be quite easy. ||| 要做到呢樣嘢其實好易 
 Less meat, less junk, more plants. ||| 食少啲肉、少啲垃圾食物，多啲食菜 
 It's a simple formula: eat food. ||| 好簡單嘅竅門，就係進食 
 Eat real food. ||| 食真正嘅食物 
 We can continue to enjoy our food, and we continue to eat well, and we can eat even better. ||| 我哋可以繼續享受食物，繼續食得好 而且可以食得更有益 
 We can continue the search for the ingredients we love, and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals. ||| 仲可以繼續尋找鍾意嘅食材 繼續係我哋喜愛嘅餐點編寫故事 
 We'll reduce not only calories, but our carbon footprint. ||| 我哋唔單止要減少進食卡路里，仲要減少碳足印 
 We can make food more important, not less, and save ourselves by doing so. ||| 我哋可以令食物更重要，而唔係令食物唔再受人重視 而且咁做可以教到我哋 
 We have to choose that path. ||| 我哋要揀呢條路去行啦 
 Thank you. ||| 多謝 
 It was consistent. ||| 每個禮拜都係咁 
 So I would need a piano to practice on, and an hour later I would be at a fan's house. ||| 譬如話，我需要一部鋼琴練習 一個小時後 我就喺歌迷屋企彈琴 
 This is a library in Auckland. ||| 呢度係奧克蘭一個圖書館 
 We sign with a major label. ||| 我哋同一間大型唱片公司簽約 
 And I fell into those thousands of connections that I'd made, and I asked my crowd to catch me. ||| 所以我嗰陣只能夠 靠我聯絡過嘅幾千個支持者 我當時希望支持者可以支持我 
 (Applause) And you can see how many people it is. ||| （掌聲） 你可以睇到有幾多人支持 
 And a lot of artists have a problem with this. ||| 好多藝術家都面對呢個問題 
 And at the next stop, a guy gets on the car, and he has this sort of visiting professor look to him. ||| 到下一個站，有個男人上車 睇佢個樣好似係大學教授 
 The guy on the right had a knife with a 10-inch blade, and he went in under my elbow, and it went up and cut my inferior vena cava. ||| 右手邊嗰個人有把 10 吋長嘅刀 佢喺我手肘下面出手 把刀跟住上去，刺穿我嘅下腔大靜脈 
 The other guy was still working on me, collapsing my other lung, and I managed to, by hitting that guy, to get a minute. ||| 但係第二個人仍然打我 打傷我另一邊肺部 我還擊嗰個人，爭取一分鐘時間 
 I think some of you were, too. ||| 我估你哋一啲人都係 
 (Laughter) And you, sir, who laughed the loudest, you probably still are. (Laughter) ||| （笑聲） 仲有你呀，阿生 笑得最大聲嗰個，睇嚟宜家都仲係 （笑聲） 
 I grew up in a small town in the dusty plains of north Texas, the son of a sheriff who was the son of a pastor. ||| 我喺德州北部平原一個鎮仔大嘅 我阿爺係牧師，我老豆係警察 
 Getting into trouble was not an option. ||| 所以自細就係乖乖仔 
 And so I started reading calculus books for fun. ||| 睇微積分書當娛樂 
 (Laughter) You did, too. ||| （笑聲） 你都係咧 
 That led me to building a laser and a computer and model rockets, and that led me to making rocket fuel in my bedroom. ||| 於是我自己整 激光啦、電腦啦、火箭模型啦 最後仲喺房裏邊整埋火箭燃料 
 Now, in scientific terms, we call this a very bad idea. ||| 用我哋宜家科學嘅講法 係搞搞震無幫襯 
 I loved everything about that movie, especially the HAL 9000. ||| 我係部片嘅忠實擁躉 特別中意哈爾 9000 
 Now, HAL was a sentient computer designed to guide the Discovery spacecraft from the Earth to Jupiter. ||| 哈爾係一部機械人 專為太空船導航而設計 指引太空船由地球飛往木星 
 HAL was also a flawed character, for in the end he chose to value the mission over human life. ||| 但哈爾都有缺點 佢最後為實現目的而罔顧人類安全 
 I believe that such fears are unfounded. ||| 我認為呢種恐懼唔成立 
 If there's trouble, there's not enough time. ||| 所以如果中途出咗咩問題 
 In other words, I needed to build something very much like a HAL but without the homicidal tendencies. ||| 換句話嚟講，我要整到好似哈爾咁樣 不過係唔會當人類 係冚家鏟要消滅嘅機械人 
 (Laughter) Let's pause for a moment. ||| （笑聲） 等陣先 
 Is it really possible to build an artificial intelligence like that? ||| 咁係咪真係有可能整個咁嘅機械人先？ 
 Actually, it is. ||| 其實，係可以嘅 
 To paraphrase Alan Turing, I'm not interested in building a sentient machine. ||| 學 Alan Turning 話齋 我無興趣整隻有感覺嘅機器 
 I'm not building a HAL. ||| 亦都唔係生產另一個哈爾 
 All I'm after is a simple brain, something that offers the illusion of intelligence. ||| 我所追求嘅係一個會簡單思考 同有少少智慧嘅機械人 
 Yes. ||| 可以 
 Can we build systems that converse with humans in natural language? ||| 我哋可唔可以 整隻機械人出嚟識講人話？ 
 Yes. ||| 可以 
 Yes. ||| 可以 
 Yes. ||| 可以 
 This we are learning to do. ||| 我哋宜家嘗試緊 
 Can we build systems that have an ethical and moral foundation? ||| 我哋可唔可以整隻機械人 明白道德觀念同底線？ 
 This we must learn how to do. ||| 呢個任務我哋責無旁貸 
 When we first saw cars, people lamented that we would see the destruction of the family. ||| 以前啲人第一次見到汽車時 就驚車禍會造成家破人亡 
 When we first saw telephones come in, people were worried it would destroy all civil conversation. ||| 以前第一次見到電話時 啲人就驚人同人之間嘅交流會受到破壞 
 At a point in time we saw the written word become pervasive, people thought we would lose our ability to memorize. ||| 曾幾何時啲人見到文字可以傳送 又驚人類嘅記憶力會喪失 
 So let's take this a little further. ||| 我哋不如再講遠啲 
 I do not fear the creation of an AI like this, because it will eventually embody some of our values. ||| 我唔驚呢啲人工智能面世 因為佢最終會接受人類嘅一啲價值 
 We don't program them. We teach them. ||| 我哋而家唔係編程機械人 
 In order to teach a system how to play a game — Well, I would. You would, too. ||| 為咗教曉機械人點打機—— 我真係教㗎。你都會咁做 
 In scientific terms, this is what we call ground truth, and here's the important point: in producing these machines, we are therefore teaching them a sense of our values. ||| 套用科學術語 呢啲係我哋所謂嘅參考標準 而且重要嘅係： 製造呢啲機械人時 我哋將自己嘅價值觀灌輸畀佢 
 To that end, I trust an artificial intelligence the same, if not more, as a human who is well-trained. ||| 最終，我相信人工智能 會同一個受過專業訓練嘅人一樣 
 Now, these kinds of substances are much larger, and we'll certainly see them coming. ||| 人工智能係複雜好多嘅嘢 但我相信遲早有一日人工智能會出現 
 Dr. Bostrom has a number of followers. ||| 有人支持博森博士嘅觀點 
 He is supported by people such as Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking. ||| 包括 Elon Musk 同霍金 
 So it would have to be with a superintelligence. ||| 所以任務需要一個超智能機器 
 It would have to have dominion over all of our world. ||| 落命令嘅需要有統治世界嘅能力 
 Practically speaking, it ain't gonna happen. ||| 即係話 電影情節係唔會發生 
 And furthermore, if such an artificial intelligence existed, it would have to compete with human economies, and thereby compete for resources with us. ||| 再者，如果咁樣嘅機械人真係存在 佢就會同人類嘅經濟鬥過 甚至同人類爭資源 
 And in the end — don't tell Siri this — we can always unplug them. ||| 最終結果係—— 唔好話俾 Siri 聽—— 我哋可以隨時熄咗佢哋 
 And that's the exciting thing. ||| 諗下都覺得興奮 
 So, how did it just do that? ||| 咁點樣做到自動反饋呢？ 
 It's the magic that brings these machines to life. ||| 算法賦予呢啲機器活力 
 So how does one design the algorithms that create a machine athlete? ||| 咁係點樣設計出算法 令機器可以郁嘅呢？ 
 We first captured the dynamics with a set of differential equations. ||| 首先，用一系列微分方程 掌握佢嘅運動數據 
 Notice how the quad lost altitude when I put this glass of water on it. ||| 留意喺我放杯水上去嘅時候 
 And that's why you don't need to model the glass. ||| 亦因為咁，你無需為玻璃杯整數學模型 
 We've all heard stories of athletes performing feats while physically injured. ||| 我哋都聽過運動員受傷都可以完成壯舉 
 Can a machine also perform with extreme physical damage? ||| 咁機器可唔可以 喺極度損壞嘅情況下運作？ 
 Mathematical models tell us exactly when and why this is possible. ||| 數學模型精確咁話畀我哋知 
 Will the diver be able to pull off a rip entry? ||| 睇下究竟跳水嘅可唔可以壓住水花 
 Will the vaulter stick the landing? ||| 撐杆跳嘅可唔可以站立著地 
 We first figure out where the ball is going. ||| 我哋第一步睇下個波飛去邊 
 These three quads are cooperatively carrying a sky net. ||| 呢三部四旋翼就一齊帶住個球網飛 
 Notice that, at full extension, these quads are vertical. ||| 注意囉，個網全部打開個陣 
 Here, the quad is behaving as if it were in a viscous fluid. ||| 依家四旋翼就好似喺粘性流體度 
 Let's have a little bit of fun with this. ||| 等我哋嚟玩下呢樣 
 Like all our past creations and innovations, they may be used to improve the human condition or they may be misused and abused. ||| 同我哋以前所有嘅創造發明一樣 佢哋可能用嚟改善人類嘅生活條件 亦都可能俾人誤用或者濫用 
 They're the current members of the Flying Machine Arena research team. ||| 佢哋係飛行器競技場 研究小組嘅現任成員 
 Look out for them. They're destined for great things. ||| 請留意佢哋 佢哋日後一定會有偉大嘅成就 
 What do I mean by fluent? ||| 噉純熟係咩呢? 
 And it's similar with new technologies. ||| 新科技都係同樣道理 
 Now maybe you won't be so surprised by this, because a lot of times people feel that young people today can do all sorts of things with technology. ||| 你或者對呢樣嘢唔覺得驚訝 因為好多時人都會覺得 現今年輕人可以用科技做各式各樣嘅嘢 
 I'm not so sure we should be thinking of young people as digital natives. ||| 但我就唔太肯定 
 It's almost as if they can read but not write with new technologies. ||| 即係話佢哋識得用新科技去睇嘢 但唔識得用新科技去寫嘢一樣 
 And I'm really interested in seeing, how can we help young people become fluent so they can write with new technologies? ||| 而我就真係好想知道 令佢哋能夠用新科技去創作 
 So, increasingly, people are starting to recognize the importance of learning to code. ||| 於是，有趣地，人就開始認清 學習寫編碼嘅重要性 
 It seems that everybody is getting into the act. ||| 每一個人似乎都開始參與其中 
 A few months later, the country of Estonia decided that all of its first graders should learn to code. ||| 幾個月後，愛沙尼亞政府決定 全國一年級學生都要學寫編碼 
 about whether all the children there should learn to code. ||| 係咪要俾全部小朋友學寫編碼 
 Now, for some of you, when you hear about this, it might seem sort of strange about everybody learning to code. ||| 宜家，你哋部分人，聽到呢個提議時 或者會覺得有啲奇怪 
 But coding doesn't have to be like this. ||| 但寫編碼唔需要噉樣 
 Let me show you about what it's like to code in Scratch. ||| 就等我俾你睇下Scratch 裏邊嘅編碼 係點樣啦 
 So in Scratch, to code, you just snap blocks together. ||| 喺 Scratch 裏面寫編碼 就好似砌積木噉 
 "After you've created your program, you can click on ""share,"" and then share your project with other people, so that they can use the project and start working on the project as well." ||| 當你整咗個程式之後 然後你就可以將你個程式同其他人分享 人哋就可以用到你嘅程式 而且可以對個程式做修改 
 You can also code to interact with the physical world around you. ||| 你可以寫一啲 可以同你周圍現實世界互動嘅編碼 
 We're going to continue to look at new ways of bringing together the physical world and the virtual world and connecting to the world around us. ||| 至於我哋，我哋會繼續搵新嘅方式 將現實世界同虛擬世界帶到黎 去連接我哋嘅世界 
 It uses the webcam. ||| 有個程式需要用到網絡攝影機 
 Because as they learn to code, it enables them to learn many other things, opens up many new opportunities for learning. ||| 因為喺學習寫編碼嘅過程中 佢哋學到其他好多嘢 得到好多學習嘅新機會 
 Again, it's useful to make an analogy to reading and writing. ||| 同樣地 
 When you learn to read, you can then read to learn. ||| 當你學習閱讀嘅時候 
 And it's the same thing with coding. ||| 寫編碼都係一樣 
 Now some of the things you can learn are sort of obvious. ||| 有啲你可以學嘅嘢係睇得到嘅 
 You learn more about how computers work. ||| 譬如你會知道電腦點樣運作 
 But that's just where it starts. ||| 但呢樣只係第一樣 
 Let me show you an example. ||| 等我舉個例 
 So I showed him. ||| 所以我就話俾佢知點整 
 In Scratch, you can create something called a variable. ||| 喺 Scratch 裏面 
 "And that creates some new blocks for you, and also creates a little scoreboard that keeps track of the score, so each time I click on ""change score,"" it increments the score." ||| 跟著個軟件會幫你建立幾個新積木 並且會建立一個細嘅計分板 當我每次點擊「更新分數」嘅時候 
 Now he had a reason for learning variables. ||| 宜家，佢終於有一個學習變量嘅原因 
 Again, it's useful to think about this analogy with language. ||| 再一次 
 Again, the same thing with coding. ||| 呢個同寫編碼係同一道理 
 And it's not just about your work life. ||| 唔剩止你份工 
 Let me end with just one more example. ||| 就俾我再講多一個例子嚟到結束 
 So she made this project for my birthday and sent me a happy birthday Scratch card. ||| 於是佢喺我嘅生日嗰時整咗呢個項目 發咗張 Scratch 生日卡俾我 
 Now this project is not going to win any prizes for design, and you can rest assured that my 83-year-old mom is not training to become a professional programmer or computer scientist. ||| 雖然宜家呢個作品唔會贏到設計獎 而且你可以坐係度好肯定 唔係為咗受訓成為專業程式員 
 Thanks very much. (Applause) ||| 多謝哂 
 I'm here to talk to you about the economic invisibility of nature. ||| 我係呢度同大家討論 大自然嘅經濟無形性 
 The bad news is that mother nature's back office isn't working yet, so those invoices don't get issued. ||| 有個壞消息 係大自然嘅後勤部門其實運作唔到 所以仲未出發票 
 But we need to do something about this problem. ||| 但我哋需要處理呢個問題 
 I began my life as a markets professional and continued to take an interest, but most of my recent effort has been looking at the value of what comes to human beings from nature, and which doesn't get priced by the markets. ||| 我從事市場專業 我一向熱愛工作 不過最近我大部分精力 都投放到研究 人類開發自然資源嘅價值 但佢地仍然未有價錢牌 
 A project called TEEB was started in 2007, and it was launched by a group of environment ministers of the G8+5. ||| 一個名為TEEB的計劃係2007年開始 係由一群環保官員成立 成員係來自G8+5 
 And their basic inspiration was a stern review of Lord Stern. ||| 佢哋嘅基本理念 是認真審視斯特恩勳爵嘅見解 
 They asked themselves a question: If economics could make such a convincing case for early action on climate change, well why can't the same be done for conservation? ||| 佢哋問咗自己一個問題： 如果經濟能夠有說服力去解釋 及早對抗氣候變化嘅重要性 咁點解保育唔可以咁做？ 
 Why can't an equivalent case be made for nature? ||| 點解同一道理唔可以 套用到大自然呢？ 
 And the answer is: Yeah, it can. ||| 而答案係：無錯，可以 
 But it's not that straightforward. ||| 但並唔係咁直接 
 Biodiversity, the living fabric of this planet, is not a gas. ||| 生物多樣性, 地球上活嘅結構而非氣體 
 It exists in many layers, ecosystems, species and genes across many scales — international, national, local, community — and doing for nature what Lord Stern and his team did for nature is not that easy. ||| 佢存在係好多個層面 遍佈眾多個生態系統、物種同基因 — 不論國際、國內、本地、社區 — 生物多樣性都回饋大自然 斯特恩勳爵同佢嘅團隊為自然界付出嘅努力殊不簡單 
 And yet, we began. ||| 我哋開始咗第一步 
 We began the project with an interim report, which quickly pulled together a lot of information that had been collected on the subject by many, many researchers. ||| 個計劃由一份中期報告開始 裡面綜合咗係短時間內 大量由研究員搜集返嚟關於 呢個課題嘅資料 
 And amongst our compiled results was the startling revelation that, in fact, we were losing natural capital — the benefits that flow from nature to us. ||| 而係我哋編輯嘅結果之中 有一個驚人嘅發現 就是其實我們正在損失自然資源 — 即係從大自然流比我哋嘅好處 
 We were losing it at an extraordinary rate — in fact, of the order of two to four trillion dollars-worth of natural capital. ||| 原來我哋以驚人嘅速度損耗緊 — 價值高達200至400萬兆美元 嘅自然資源 
 This came out in 2008, which was, of course, around the time that the banking crisis had shown that we had lost financial capital of the order of two and a half trillion dollars. ||| 報告於2008年發表 亦即係金融海嘯嘅時候 揭示投資市場 已虧損達2至3億美元 
 So this was comparable in size to that kind of loss. ||| 自然資源損耗嘅規模亦達至同一規模 
 We then have gone on since to present for [the] international community, for governments, for local governments and for business and for people, for you and me, a whole slew of reports, which were presented at the U.N. last year, which address the economic invisibility of nature and describe what can be done to solve it. ||| 於是我哋開始 為國際社會 為各個政府 為本地政府同商界 為全球人類，為你同我 去年在聯合國發佈咗呢堆報告 針對大自然經濟嘅無形性 去表達解決方法 
 What is this about? ||| 究竟係咩呢? 
 A picture that you're familiar with — the Amazon rainforests. ||| 一幅大家好熟悉的圖像 — 亞馬遜雨林 
 It's a massive store of carbon, it's an amazing store of biodiversity, but what people don't really know is this also is a rain factory. ||| 佢係一個巨大嘅碳庫存，一個擁有生物多樣性嘅庫存 但好多人都唔知 呢個亦係一個雨水工廠 
 Because the northeastern trade winds, as they go over the Amazonas, effectively gather the water vapor. ||| 因為當東北信風 橫過亞馬遜納嘅時候 好有效咁收集水蒸氣 
 Something like 20 billion tons per day of water vapor is sucked up by the northeastern trade winds, and eventually precipitates in the form of rain across the La Plata Basin. ||| 每日大約20萬億噸水蒸氣 被東北信風吸走 慢慢冷卻成降雨 落到拉普拉塔河盆 
 This rainfall cycle, this rainfall factory, effectively feeds an agricultural economy of the order of 240 billion dollars-worth in Latin America. ||| 呢個降雨循環，呢個雨水工廠 有效咁孕育著一個農業經濟 價值達240萬億美元 位於拉丁美洲 
 But the question arises: Okay, so how much do Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina and indeed the state of Mato Grosso in Brazil pay for that vital input to that economy to the state of Amazonas, which produces that rainfall? ||| 有一個問題 究景烏拉圭、巴拉圭、阿根廷 仲有巴西馬托格羅索州 需要為呢個咁重要經濟輸入 為生產雨水嘅亞馬遜納州付出幾多呢？ 
 And the answer is zilch, exactly zero. ||| 答案是無 係零 
 That's the economic invisibility of nature. ||| 呢個就係大自然經濟嘅無形性 
 That can't keep going on, because economic incentives and disincentives are very powerful. ||| 呢個情況唔可以持續落去 因為經濟誘因同抑制因素好強大 
 Economics has become the currency of policy. ||| 經濟已經成為政策嘅籌碼 
 And unless we address this invisibility, we are going to get the results that we are seeing, which is a gradual degradation and loss of this valuable natural asset. ||| 除非我們正視 呢嗰無形性 否則我哋會面對一如所料嘅後果 目送珍貴嘅天然財產 逐漸退化同喪失 
 It's not just about the Amazonas, or indeed about rainforests. ||| 呢個唔單只關係到亞馬遜納同雨林 
 No matter what level you look at, whether it's at the ecosystem level or at the species level or at the genetic level, we see the same problem again and again. ||| 無論邊個層面 無論係生態系統定係物種或者基因層面 呢個問題都係無處不在 
 So rainfall cycle and water regulation by rainforests at an ecosystem level. ||| 雨林嘅降雨循環同水調節 係生態系統層面也好 
 At the species level, it's been estimated that insect-based pollination, bees pollinating fruit and so on, is something like 190 billion dollars-worth. ||| 係物種層面也好 估計昆蟲傳播花粉 蜜蜂為果實授粉等等 約值190萬億美元 
 That's something like eight percent of the total agricultural output globally. ||| 呢個差不多相當於 全球總農產量百分之8 
 It completely passes below the radar screen. ||| 但我哋完全忽略咗這點 
 But when did a bee actually ever give you an invoice? ||| 但蜜蜂幾時發張發票比我哋? 
 Or for that matter, if you look at the genetic level, 60 percent of medicines were prospected, were found first as molecules in a rainforest or a reef. ||| 或者，從基因層面睇嘅話 六成藥物係開發時 只係雨林或暗礁中嘅化學分子 
 Once again, most of that doesn't get paid. ||| 同樣唔洗一分一毫 
 And that brings me to another aspect of this, which is, to whom should this get paid? ||| 呢個帶我到問題嘅另一面 就係應該邊個收錢? 
 That genetic material probably belonged, if it could belong to anyone, to a local community of poor people who parted with the knowledge that helped the researchers to find the molecule, which then became the medicine. ||| 呢的基因物質 如果屬於任何人嘅話，大概屬於 貧窮社區嘅人 佢哋缺乏比研究員找到化學分子嘅知識 而呢的最終成為藥物 
 They were the ones that didn't get paid. ||| 佢地一無所得 
 And if you look at the species level, you saw about fish. ||| 如果你睇吓物種層次 你睇見魚類 
 Today, the depletion of ocean fisheries is so significant that effectively it is effecting the ability of the poor, the artisanal fisher folk and those who fish for their own livelihoods, to feed their families. ||| 今日, 海洋漁產嘅損耗非常顯著 迅速蠶食 從古到今 都以捕魚維生 和養妻活兒的人嘅生活 
 Something like a billion people depend on fish, the quantity of fish in the oceans. ||| 全球大約10億人依賴魚類 依賴海洋中的魚量 
 A billion people depend on fish for their main source for animal protein. ||| 10億人依賴魚類 作為動物蛋白質的主要來源 
 And at this rate at which we are losing fish, it is a human problem of enormous dimensions, a health problem of a kind we haven't seen before. ||| 按目前魚類損耗速度 係一個龐大的人禍 一個前所未有嘅 健康問題 
 And finally, at the ecosystem level, whether it's flood prevention or drought control provided by the forests, or whether it is the ability of poor farmers to go out and gather leaf litter for their cattle and goats, or whether it's the ability of their wives to go and collect fuel wood from the forest, it is actually the poor who depend most on these ecosystem services. ||| 最後，喺生態系統層面 無論係樹林防洪或防旱功能 甚至係貧困嘅農民 外出收集枯枝落葉 供家畜家畜 或者佢哋嘅妻子 去樹林執柴枝 即係貧窮嘅一群人 最依賴呢類生態系統幫助 
 We did estimates in our study that for countries like Brazil, India and Indonesia, even though ecosystem services — these benefits that flow from nature to humanity for free — they're not very big in percentage terms of GDP — two, four, eight, 10, 15 percent — but in these countries, if we measure how much they're worth to the poor, the answers are more like 45 percent, 75 percent, 90 percent. ||| 我哋嘅研究估計 巴西、印度、印尼等國家 縱使生態系統服務 — 呢類從大自然免費流到人類嘅益處 — 或者佔國內生產總值百分比唔多 — 百分之 2, 4, 8, 10 或者15不等 — 但係呢的國家，如果計算佢地對貧窮人口嘅價值 得出嘅數字係 百分之45, 75 甚至90 
 That's the difference. ||| 差異就係呢度 
 Because these are important benefits for the poor. ||| 因為佢哋對貧窮嘅人嚟講好重要 
 And you can't really have a proper model for development if at the same time you're destroying or allowing the degradation of the very asset, the most important asset, which is your development asset, that is ecological infrastructure. ||| 而你唔可以指望有一個正統嘅發展模式 如果你同時破壞或任由 呢嗰珍貴同賴以發展 嘅資源退化 即係呢個生態系統 
 How bad can things get? ||| 情況將會有幾壞? 
 Well here a picture of something called the mean species abundance. ||| 呢度有張叫做平均物種豐度嘅圖片 
 It's basically a measure of how many tigers, toads, ticks or whatever on average of biomass of various species are around. ||| 基本上量度 老虎、蟾蜍、壁蝨諸如此類嘅平均數量 同各物種嘅生物重量 
 The green represents the percentage. ||| 綠色部分代表百分比 
 If you start green, it's like 80 to 100 percent. ||| 先看綠色嘅話，呢度大概有百分之80至100 
 If it's yellow, it's 40 to 60 percent. ||| 再睇黃色，便有百分之40至60 
 And these are percentages versus the original state, so to speak, the pre-industrial era, 1750. ||| 呢嗰係對比原有數量嘅百分比 即是工業化前，1750年 
 Now I'm going to show you how business as usual will affect this. ||| 而家我會比大家睇 目前情況不變會造成咩後果 
 And just watch the change in colors in India, China, Europe, sub-Saharan Africa as we move on and consume global biomass at a rate which is actually not going to be able to sustain us. ||| 只需要留意顏色轉變 係印度、中國、歐洲、 非洲撒哈拉以南 我哋隨著不可持續嘅速度 消耗全球生物量 
 See that again. ||| 再睇 
 The only places that remain green — and that's not good news — is, in fact, places like the Gobi Desert, like the tundra and like the Sahara. ||| 一個壞消息, 僅存綠色嘅地方 只係戈壁沙漠區域 譬如苔原，譬如撒哈拉 
 But that doesn't help because there were very few species and volume of biomass there in the first place. ||| 不過無用, 因為物種好少 而佢哋生物量體積本身已經唔多 
 This is the challenge. ||| 這個就係挑戰所在 
 The reason this is happening boils down, in my mind, to one basic problem, which is our inability to perceive the difference between public benefits and private profits. ||| 原因就係 歸根究底，我認為係一個基本問題 我地忽視咗 公益 同私利之間嘅差別 
 We tend to constantly ignore public wealth simply because it is in the common wealth, it's common goods. ||| 我哋一向漠視公共財富 純粹因為大家嘅福祉 大家係好處 
 And here's an example from Thailand where we found that, because the value of a mangrove is not that much — it's about $600 over the life of nine years that this has been measured — compared to its value as a shrimp farm, which is more like $9,600, there has been a gradual trend to deplete the mangroves and convert them to shrimp farms. ||| 有一個泰國嘅例子 我哋發現由於紅樹林價值唔高 — 以佢哋九年生命大概值600美元 — 比較作為養蝦場嘅價值 約莫係9600美元 紅樹林已經就嚟絕跡 並被轉換為養蝦場 
 But of course, if you look at exactly what those profits are, almost 8,000 of those dollars are, in fact, subsidies. ||| 如果仔細探究牟得嘅利益係咩 當中接近8000美元 其實都是補貼 
 So you compare the two sides of the coin and you find that it's more like 1,200 to 600. ||| 所以權衡利弊嘅時候 就會發現實際利潤分別是1200同600美元 
 That's not that hard. ||| 唔太難明白 
 But on the other hand, if you start measuring, how much would it actually cost to restore the land of the shrimp farm back to productive use? ||| 另外如果計算 將養蝦場嘅土地 翻新恢復生產用途 代價將會係幾多? 
 Once salt deposition and chemical deposition has had its effects, that answer is more like $12,000 of cost. ||| 一旦鹽同化學嘅含量 起咗作用 成本大概係12000美元 
 And if you see the benefits of the mangrove in terms of the storm protection and cyclone protection that you get and in terms of the fisheries, the fish nurseries, that provide fish for the poor, that answer is more like $11,000. ||| 如果諗下保留紅樹林嘅好處 包括抵禦風暴, 防範颱風 為漁產，為窮民提供漁獲 嘅魚類繁殖場 答案係11,000美元 
 So now look at the different lens. ||| 試吓從另一角度去睇 
 If you look at the lens of public wealth as against the lens of private profits, you get a completely different answer, which is clearly conservation makes more sense, and not destruction. ||| 如果從公共財富出發 而非私人利益 我哋會得到一個好唔同嘅答案 亦即係保育顯然更合理 而唔係破壞 
 So is this just a story from South Thailand? ||| 呢嗰係咪只係泰國南部嘅情況? 
 Sorry, this is a global story. ||| 唔係, 呢個係全世界嘅狀況 
 And here's what the same calculation looks like, which was done recently — well I say recently, over the last 10 years — by a group called TRUCOST. ||| 以同一方式計算 即最近十年嚟講 由一個名為TRUCOST嘅組織進行 
 And they calculated for the top 3,000 corporations, what are the externalities? ||| 佢哋為最頂尖3,000家大公司計算 有咩外在因素？ 
 In other words, what are the costs of doing business as usual? ||| 換句話說，如常營商嘅成本係幾多？ 
 This is not illegal stuff, this is basically business as usual, which causes climate-changing emissions, which have an economic cost. ||| 唔係指非法勾當，只是一般營商， 會導致改變氣候嘅排放，附帶著經濟成本 
 It causes pollutants being issued, which have an economic cost, health cost and so on. ||| 持續放出污染物，附帶著經濟成本 健康成本等等 
 Use of freshwater. ||| 亦包括淡水利用 
 If you drill water to make coke near a village farm, that's not illegal, but yes, it costs the community. ||| 如果你係鄉村耕地旁邊鑽鑿水源去煉焦炭 雖無違法，但的確賠上社區嘅生活 
 Can we stop this, and how? ||| 我哋可以阻止嗎? 點樣阻止? 
 I think the first point to make is that we need to recognize natural capital. ||| 我認為第一點係需要認識自然資源 
 Basically the stuff of life is natural capital, and we need to recognize and build that into our systems. ||| 簡單講生物就是自然資源 我哋需要認識同生活模式入面 
 When we measure GDP as a measure of economic performance at the national level, we don't include our biggest asset at the country level. ||| 當量度國民生產總值 作為國家層面經濟表現嘅標準 我哋並無包括自然界嘅資源 
 When we measure corporate performances, we don't include our impacts on nature and what our business costs society. ||| 當我哋量度業績 我哋亦無包括對大自然嘅影響 以及社會為經商承擔嘅代價 
 That has to stop. ||| 一定要停止 
 In fact, this was what really inspired my interest in this phase. ||| 呢嗰亦係我目前最有興趣嘅野 
 I began a project way back called the Green Accounting Project. ||| 之前我搞咗一個綠色帳單計劃 
 That was in the early 2000s when India was going gung-ho about GDP growth as the means forward — looking at China with its stellar growths of eight, nine, 10 percent and wondering, why can we do the same? ||| 大約係2000年代初 當時印度嘅國內生產總值增長強勁 被視為前進嘅路向 — 眼看著中國有百分之8至10 的增長 佢哋問, 點解我哋做唔到? 
 And a few friends of mine and I decided this doesn't make sense. ||| 我同幾個朋友 都覺得好唔合理 
 This is going to create more cost to society and more losses. ||| 呢個將會為社會帶嚟更多負擔 
 So we decided to do a massive set of calculations and started producing green accounts for India and its states. ||| 於是我哋決定計算 又開始為印度各地做綠色帳單 
 That's how my interests began and went to the TEEB project. ||| 我嘅志趣就係咁樣開始 後來演變成TEEB計劃 
 Calculating this at the national level is one thing, and it has begun. ||| 在國家層面計算呢種綠色帳單 
 And the World Bank has acknowledged this and they've started a project called WAVES — Wealth Accounting and Valuation of Ecosystem Services. ||| 而世界銀行亦確認咗呢個計畫 開展名為WAVES — 全球生態系統 和生態系統服務評價以及財富核算伙伴計劃 
 But calculating this at the next level, that means at the business sector level, is important. ||| 計算嘅層面, 轉去 商界層面，呢點好重要 
 And actually we've done this with the TEEB project. ||| 事實上我哋亦都係TEEB計劃做過 
 We've done this for a very difficult case, which was for deforestation in China. ||| 我哋做咗一個好棘手嘅個案 中國的伐林問題 
 This is important, because in China in 1997, the Yellow River actually went dry for nine months causing severe loss of agriculture output and pain and loss to society. ||| 非常重要, 因為中國係1997年 黃河就足足乾涸咗九個月 導致農產出劇烈損失 仲有對社會帶嚟損失和禍害 
 Just a year later the Yangtze flooded, causing something like 5,500 deaths. ||| 一年後長江泛濫 造成差不多5,500人死亡 
 So clearly there was a problem with deforestation. ||| 伐林就係問題根源 
 It was associated largely with the construction industry. ||| 好大程度上聯繫到建築業 
 And the Chinese government responded sensibly and placed a ban on felling. ||| 而中國政府明智作出回應 亦禁止了砍伐林木 
 A retrospective on 40 years shows that if we had accounted for these costs — the cost of loss of topsoil, the cost of loss of waterways, the lost productivity, the loss to local communities as a result of all these factors, desertification and so on — those costs are almost twice as much as the market price of timber. ||| 回顧40年 顯示如果當初我地有負起呢個成本 — 包括表土流失 水道喪失 生產力嘅損失，因為伐木造成 對本地社區嘅破壞 荒漠化等等 — 呢的成本幾乎係 木材市價嘅兩倍 
 So in fact, the price of timber in the Beijing marketplace ought to have been three-times what it was had it reflected the true pain and the costs to the society within China. ||| 因此事實上，北京市場上嘅木材價格 應該係現時嘅三倍 如果有反映 中國社會付出嘅代價 
 Of course, after the event one can be wise. ||| 當然，經一事長一智 
 The way to do this is to do it on a company basis, to take leadership forward, and to do it for as many important sectors which have a cost, and to disclose these answers. ||| 處理辦法就是係以公司為基礎 帶頭做起 為愈多要付成本嘅重要界別計算得愈好 同埋披露呢的數字 
 "Someone once asked me, ""Who is better or worse, is it Unilever or is it P&G when it comes to their impact on rainforests in Indonesia?"" And I couldn't answer because neither of these companies, good though they are and professional though they are, do not calculate or disclose their externalities." ||| 有人曾經問我 若考慮對印尼雨林嘅影響 聯合利華 還是 P&G 比較好? 我唔識答，因為呢兩家公司 雖然好專業 但都無計算或披露過外在因素 
 But if we look at companies like PUMA — Jochen Zeitz, their CEO and chairman, once challenged me at a function, saying that he's going to implement my project before I finish it. ||| 如果我哋睇吓彪馬等公司 — 約亨塞茲，佢哋嘅行政總裁同董事長， 曾經係一個活動 同我講佢會係我完成之前就計好咗 
 Well I think we kind of did it at the same time, but he's done it. ||| 學無前後, 達者為先 
 He's basically worked the cost to PUMA. ||| 基本上為彪馬計算成本 
 PUMA has 2.7 billion dollars of turnover, 300 million dollars of profits, 200 million dollars after tax, 94 million dollars of externalities, cost to business. ||| 彪馬嘅營業額達27億美元 有3億利潤 交稅後有兩億 當中9400百萬外在因素，營商成本 
 "Now that's not a happy situation for them, but they have the confidence and the courage to come forward and say, ""Here's what we are measuring." ||| 情况雖然不利 但佢哋有信心同勇氣 佢走埋嚟同我哋講 
 "We are measuring it because we know that you cannot manage what you do not measure."" That's an example, I think, for us to look at and for us to draw comfort from." ||| ""我哋進行計算, 因為我哋深知" "唔去計永遠都管理唔到" 呢個例子, 可以作為示範 亦令人感到安慰" 
 If more companies did this, and if more sectors engaged this as sectors, you could have analysts, business analysts, and you could have people like us and consumers and NGOs actually look and compare the social performance of companies. ||| 如果更多公司都做 如果更多界別參予 可以比分析員 或者一般消費者或非牟利組織去 去審視同比較企業嘅社會表現 
 Today we can't yet do that, but I think the path is laid out. ||| 雖然仍未成事，但已有路可循 
 This can be done. ||| 係有可能做到 
 And I'm delighted that the Institute of Chartered Accountants in the U.K. ||| 而我好慶幸英國特許會計師協會 
 has already set up a coalition to do this, an international coalition. ||| 已經成立一個國際聯盟 進行計算工作 
 The other favorite, if you like, solution for me is the creation of green carbon markets. ||| 另一個我喜歡嘅方法 就係創造綠色碳市場 
 And by the way, these are my favorites — externalities calculation and green carbon markets. ||| 講開又講，我真係好喜歡 計算外呢類因素同埋綠色碳市場 
 TEEB has more than a dozen separate groups of solutions including protected area evaluation and payments for ecosystem services and eco-certification and you name it, but these are the favorites. ||| TEEB有超過12組不同方案 包括評估保護區 為生態服務結帳 生態驗證等形形式式 
 What's green carbon? ||| 咩係綠色碳？ 
 Today what we have is basically a brown carbon marketplace. ||| 而家我哋有嘅係褪色嘅碳市場 
 It's about energy emissions. ||| 同能源排放有關 
 The European Union ETS is the main marketplace. ||| 歐盟排放權交易計劃就係主要市場 
 It's not doing too well. We've over-issued. ||| 由於發行過度, 表現唔理想 
 A bit like inflation: you over-issue currency, you get what you see, declining prices. ||| 就好似通脹：你大量發鈔， 然後一如所料，價格下降。 
 But that's all about energy and industry. ||| 這全都與能源和工業有關。 
 But what we're missing is also some other emissions like black carbon, that is soot. ||| 我們忽略了其他排放 例如黑色碳，即是煤煙 
 What we're also missing is blue carbon, which, by the way, is the largest store of carbon — more than 55 percent. ||| 我哋亦忽略咗藍色碳 亦即是最大嘅碳庫存 — 超過百分之55 
 Thankfully, the flux, in other words, the flow of emissions from the ocean to the atmosphere and vice versa, is more or less balanced. ||| 好欣慰, 所講嘅藍色碳係 來回海洋和大氣層之間排放同流出 差不多收支平衡 
 In fact, what's being absorbed is something like 25 percent of our emissions, which then leads to acidification or lower alkalinity in oceans. ||| 事實上，被吸收嘅 大約是我哋排放嘅四分一 佢哋會導致海洋酸化 或鹼度下降 
 More of that in a minute. ||| 我地稍後再講 
 And finally, there's deforestation, and there's emission of methane from agriculture. ||| 最後，係砍伐樹林 仲有係來自農業 甲烷排放 
 Green carbon, which is the deforestation and agricultural emissions, and blue carbon together comprise 25 percent of our emissions. ||| 綠色碳 即係來自伐林同農業排放 以及藍色碳 合共佔去我地排放嘅四分一 
 We have the means already in our hands, through a structure, through a mechanism, called REDD Plus — a scheme for the reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. ||| 其實已經有方法 透過一個結構同機制，名為REDD Plus— 一個為減少伐林同林地退化 造成嘅碳排放而設嘅計劃 
 And already Norway has contributed a billion dollars each towards Indonesia and Brazil to implement this Red Plus scheme. ||| 挪威已分別投放10億元 去印尼同巴西 推行呢個Red Plus計劃 
 So we actually have some movement forward. ||| 進展係有 
 But the thing is to do a lot more of that. ||| 但仍要花好多工夫 
 Will this solve the problem? Will economics solve everything? ||| 咁問題解決到嗎？經濟可以解決到嗎？ 
 Well I'm afraid not. ||| 未必 
 There is an area that is the oceans, coral reefs. ||| 仲有海洋、珊瑚礁 
 As you can see, they cut across the entire globe all the way from Micronesia across Indonesia, Malaysia, India, Madagascar and to the West of the Caribbean. ||| 你哋睇睇 佢哋遍佈全球 由密克羅西尼亞一直 穿過印尼、馬來西亞、印度、馬達加斯加 到加勒比海西面 
 These red dots, these red areas, basically provide the food and livelihood for more than half a billion people. ||| 呢的紅點，紅色區域 基本上為過五億人口 提供了同生計 
 So that's almost an eighth of society. ||| 大概佔全球八分一人口 
 And the sad thing is that, as these coral reefs are lost — and scientists tell us that any level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere above 350 parts per million is too dangerous for the survival of these reefs — we are not only risking the extinction of the entire coral species, the warm water corals, we're not only risking a fourth of all fish species which are in the oceans, but we are risking the very lives and livelihoods of more than 500 million people who live in the developing world in poor countries. ||| 不幸嘅係，隨著珊瑚礁損失 — 科學家指出 大氣中任何超過百萬分之350二氧化碳 對呢的珊瑚礁嘅生存構成危險 — 我哋冒嘅險並唔係 整個珊瑚物種同溫水珊瑚嘅滅絕 並唔係海洋中所有魚類四分一 而係超過五億人 嘅生命同生計 佢哋身處發展中嘅貧窮國家 
 So in selecting targets of 450 parts per million and selecting two degrees at the climate negotiations, what we have done is we've made an ethical choice. ||| 因此係選擇百萬分之450嘅目標 同氣候談判爭拗兩者嘅時候 我哋係作出一個道德抉擇 
 We've actually kind of made an ethical choice in society to not have coral reefs. ||| 幾乎係為社會作呢個決擇 去放棄珊瑚礁 
 Well what I will say to you in parting is that we may have done that. ||| 我完結前想講嘅係 呢個或者係我哋會做嘅選擇 
 Let's think about it and what it means, but please, let's not do more of that. ||| 大家諗下佢嘅含義 請唔好繼續咁做 
 Because mother nature only has that much in ecological infrastructure and that much natural capital. ||| 因為我地擁有嘅 生態系統同自然資本就只得咁多 
 I don't think we can afford too much of such ethical choices. ||| 我哋唔可再負擔呢的錯誤 
 Thank you. ||| 多謝各位 
 (Applause) ||| (獎聲) 
 It's great being here at TED. ||| 好荣幸来到TED. 
 You know, I think there might be some presentations that will go over my head, but the most amazing concepts are the ones that go right under my feet. ||| 我想到一些令我 印象深刻噶演示， 不过最精彩噶 系我脚下噶故事。 
 The little things in life, sometimes that we forget about, like pollination, that we take for granted. ||| 果D生命中微小噶野 我地有时会晤记得， 譬如大家都知道噶授粉。 
 And you can't tell the story about pollinators — bees, bats, hummingbirds, butterflies — without telling the story about the invention of flowers and how they co-evolved over 50 million years. ||| 你讲唔出有关授粉者噶故事 蜜蜂、蝙蝠、蜂鸟、蝴蝶... 而排除关于花噶诞生 以及距地点样在哩50亿年里面 共同进化。 
 I've been filming time-lapse flowers 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for over 35 years. ||| 我拍摄左花随时间推移而变化噶视频 每日24个钟，每周7日， 超过35年。 
 To watch them move is a dance I'm never going to get tired of. ||| 为了睇到距地噶变化 系孜孜不倦噶舞蹈 
 It fills me with wonder, and it opens my heart. ||| 距令我惊叹，距打开左我噶心扉。 
 Beauty and seduction, I believe, is nature's tool for survival, because we will protect what we fall in love with. ||| 我相信美丽和诱惑 系大自然噶生存工具， 因为我地会保护果D我地所爱噶野。 
 Their relationship is a love story that feeds the Earth. ||| 距地噶关系 系滋润地球噶爱情故事。 
 It reminds us that we are a part of nature, and we're not separate from it. ||| 距令我想起我地系大自然噶一部分， 并无脱离自然。 
 When I heard about the vanishing bees, Colony Collapse Disorder, it motivated me to take action. ||| 当我听到蜜蜂消失，蜂群衰落果阵， 我想即刻行动。 
 We depend on pollinators for over a third of the fruits and vegetables we eat. ||| 我地都要依赖授粉者 我地所食噶蔬菜和水果超过1/3需要距地。 
 And many scientists believe it's the most serious issue facing mankind. ||| 唔少科学家认为 哩个系人类所面临噶最严重噶问题 
 It's like the canary in the coalmine. ||| 就好似煤矿中噶金丝雀， 
 If they disappear, so do we. ||| 如果距地灭绝，人类都会消亡。 
 It reminds us that we are a part of nature and we need to take care of it. ||| 距令我想起我地系大自然噶一部分， 我地要保护好距 
 "What motivated me to film their behavior was something that I asked my scientific advisers: "What motivates the pollinators?"" ||| 令我要去拍摄距地行为噶动机来自于 我向我噶科学顾问请教左D野： 系乜嘢激发左授粉者噶积极性？ 
 "Well, their answer was, "It's all about risk and reward."" ||| 好，答案同 危险与报答有关。 
 "Like a wide-eyed kid, I'd say, ""Why is that?"" And they'd say, ""Well, because they want to survive."" I go, ""Why?"" "Well, in order to reproduce."" ||| 我就好似一个天真噶细路咁问问题：“点解噶？” 距地话：“额，因为距地想生存落去。” 我继续问：“点解噶？” “额，为左繁殖。” 
 ""Well, why?"" ||| “额..点解啊？” 
 "And I thought that they'd probably say, ""Well, it's all about sex."" And Chip Taylor, our monarch butterfly expert, he replied, ""Nothing lasts forever." ||| 我觉得距地好可能会讲：“额..同性有关。” 王蝶专家Chip Taylor话 “任何野都唔会无限持续落去， 
 "Everything in the universe wears out."" And that blew my mind." ||| 所有野最终都会在宇宙中消逝。“ 哩句话令我震撼。 
 Because I realized that nature had invented reproduction as a mechanism for life to move forward, as a life force that passes right through us and makes us a link in the evolution of life. ||| 因为我意识到 大自然创造左繁殖 来作为传承生命噶机制， 作为穿越我地噶生命力量， 距令我地成为生命进化噶纽带。 
 Rarely seen by the naked eye, this intersection between the animal world and the plant world is truly a magic moment. ||| 好难用肉眼去捕捉 哩个在动物世界和植物世界 之间噶十字路口 真系一个魔幻般噶瞬间。 
 It's the mystical moment where life regenerates itself, over and over again. ||| 生命噶自我繁殖 系一个神秘的瞬间， 生生不息。 
 So here is some nectar from my film. ||| 跟住落来噶系哩部影片噶精华 
 I hope you'll drink, tweet and plant some seeds to pollinate a friendly garden. ||| 我希望你地好好欣赏 跟住在花园里 播下种子。 
 And always take time to smell the flowers, and let it fill you with beauty, and rediscover that sense of wonder. ||| 花时间闻下D花， 距会令你充满美丽， 以及重现惊叹噶感觉。 
 Here are some images from the film. ||| 现在我地睇下哩部影片。 
 (Music) (Applause) Thank you. ||| （音乐） （鼓掌） 多谢 
 Thank you very much. ||| 多谢晒 
 (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) ||| （鼓掌） 多谢 （鼓掌） 
 In Buddhism, the lotus is a symbol for transcendence and for purity of mind and spirit. ||| 喺佛教裡邊，蓮花係超脫 同內心純潔嘅象徵 
 But a closer look at this lotus reveals each petal to be the cross-section of a slave ship. ||| 但係我哋行進啲睇呢朵蓮花 就會發現每個花瓣都係一艘 運奴船嘅切面 
 This iconic diagram was taken from a British slaving manual and later used by abolitionists to show the atrocities of slavery. ||| 敢諷刺嘅畫面黎自一本英國奴隸手冊 佢之後仲俾廢奴主義者拎黎 做證明奴隸主暴行嘅證據 
 In America, we don't like to talk about slavery, nor do we look at it as a global industry. ||| 喺美國，我哋唔鍾意講關於奴隸嘅嘢 我哋亦都唔鍾意將佢睇成係 一個全球性嘅產業 
 But by using this Buddhist symbol, I hope to universalize and transcend the history and trauma of black America and encourage discussions about our shared past. ||| 但係通過呢個佛教嘅標誌 我希望等更加多嘅人 知道美國黑人呢段歷史同創傷 再激發關於我哋歷史嘅討論 
 "To create ""Lotus,"" we carved over 6,000 figures." ||| 為咗創作「蓮」，我雕咗六千幾幅人仔 
 And this later led to a commission by the City of New York to create a 28-foot version in steel as a permanent installation at the Eagle Academy for Young Men, a school for black and latino students, the two groups most affected by this history. ||| 呢幅作品之後，等紐約嘅一個委員會 用鐵再整咗個二十八呎大嘅版本 作為老鷹男子學校嘅永久雕塑 佢係一間專門俾黑人同拉丁裔 即係受呢段歷史影響最大嘅 兩個種族嘅學校 
 The same two groups are very affected by a more recent phenomenon, but let me digress. ||| 呢兩個種族宜家俾一個 正在發生嘅現象影響緊 但係先等我講下其他嘢 
 I've been collecting wooden African figures from tourist shops and flea markets around the world. ||| 我一直收藏緊非洲嘅木雕 從旅遊商店又好，從世界 各地嘅舊貨市場又好 
 The authenticity and origin of them is completely debatable, but people believe these to be imbued with power, or even magic. ||| 好多人拗緊佢哋係咪堅嘢 同埋佢哋嘅起源 但係啲人相信佢哋充滿咗力量 甚至係魔法 
 Only recently have I figured out how to use this in my own work. ||| 呢排我先知我要點將呢啲 用系我嘅作品裡面 
 In consideration of these victims and the several times that even I, a law-abiding, Ivy League professor, have been targeted and harassed at gunpoint by the police. ||| 諗到呢啲受害者 同埋好幾次我 呢個守法嘅常春藤教授 都好幾次俾警察盤問過、同用支槍指住 
 "I created this body of work simply entitled ""BAM."" It was important to erase the identity of each of these figures, to make them all look the same and easier to disregard." ||| 所以我創造咗呢套叫做「BAM」嘅作品 重要嘅係要抹走每個人仔嘅特徵 等佢哋都睇起來一樣，唔容易俾人拎清 
 To do this, I dip them in a thick, brown wax before taking them to a shooting range where I re-sculpted them using bullets. ||| 所以我將佢哋擺起好濃嘅棕色嘅臘裡邊 再將佢哋攞去靶場 用子彈打佢哋黎重新造型 
 But my reverence for these figures kept me from actually pulling the trigger, somehow feeling as if I would be shooting myself. ||| 但係我對呢啲人仔嘅尊敬 等我唔敢真係開槍 因為我有時覺得我系度打緊自己 
 Finally, my cameraman, Raul, fired the shots. ||| 最後係我嘅攝像師 Raul 開嘅槍 
 I then took the fragments of these and created molds, and cast them first in wax, and finally in bronze like the image you see here, which bears the marks of its violent creation like battle wounds or scars. ||| 我再攞果啲碎片去做模 先用臘整出初稿 最後用銅整出定稿 就好似你哋宜家睇島嘅 帶住受過暴力對待嘅痕跡 就好似戰鬥過嘅傷口或者疤痕 
 When I showed this work recently in Miami, a woman told me she felt every gun shot to her soul. ||| 我嘅作品呢排喺邁阿密展出 有個女人同我講佢覺得 每一槍都打系佢嘅心口 
 But she also felt that these artworks memorialized the victims of these killings as well as other victims of racial violence throughout US history. ||| 但係姖又覺得呢啲作品 紀念緊各種事件中喪生嘅受害者 同埋美國歷史裡頭受過 種族暴力嘅其他受害者 
 "But ""Lotus"" and ""BAM"" are larger than just US history." ||| 但係「蓮」同「BAM」反映嘅 唔止係美國歷史 
 While showing in Berlin last year, a philosophy student asked me what prompted these recent killings. ||| 舊年喺柏林展出嗰陣 一個哲學系嘅學生問我 係咩嘢激發最近嘅事件 
 But it's only through questions like his and more thoughtful dialogue about history and race can we evolve as individuals and society. ||| 但係淨得通過好似佢呢啲問題 同埋更加多深入嘅 關於歷史同種族嘅討論 我哋先可以進化為真正嘅個人同社會 
 Thank you. ||| 多謝 
 (Applause) ||| （掌聲） 
 This is my grandfather. ||| 呢個係我祖父 
 And this is my son. ||| 呢個係我個仔 
 These are my buildings. ||| 呢啲係我參與過嘅建築物 
 But wood is the material that I love the most, and I'm going to tell you the story about wood. ||| 但木頭一直係我最喜愛嘅材料 我會講一個木頭嘅故事畀你哋聽 
 And part of the reason I love it is that every time people go into my buildings that are wood, I notice they react completely differently. ||| 我鍾意木頭，部分原因係因為 每次人哋走入我設計嘅木製建築 我發覺佢哋嘅反應完全唔一樣 
 I've actually seen how people touch the wood, and I think there's a reason for it. ||| 我睇到人哋點樣掂啲木 我相信呢個背後一定有原因 
 I like to think that wood gives Mother Nature fingerprints in our buildings. ||| 我鍾意將木諗成係 喺我哋建築物上留低嘅大自然足印 
 It's Mother Nature's fingerprints that make our buildings connect us to nature in the built environment. ||| 係大自然嘅足印令建築物 能夠將我哋同大自然連繫起嚟 
 A hundred million people in the world are homeless. ||| 一億人無家可歸 
 They're the materials of the last century. ||| 但係佢哋係上世紀嘅建材 
 Almost half of our greenhouse gases are related to the building industry, and if we look at energy, it's the same story. ||| 差唔多半數排放量嚟自建造業 能源用量方面，情況都係差唔多 
 Mass timber panels are those 24-dot bricks. ||| 巨型木嵌板就似嗰塊有廿四點嘅積木 
 And the way I describe it is this. ||| 我會咁樣講 
 If I asked you to take a match and light it and hold up a log and try to get that log to go on fire, it doesn't happen, right? We all know that. ||| 如果我請你點著一枝火柴 再將佢點著一轆木 轆木唔會著，啱唔啱？ 
 The carbon story here is a really good one. ||| 呢個就係好嘅碳故事 
 And the way I describe it is this. ||| 我會咁講 
 It just happens to be that Mother Nature holds the patent, and we don't really feel comfortable with it. ||| 因為只有大自然至擁有佢嘅專利 但對於呢點我哋無法接受 
 There's a building in London that's nine stories, a new building that just finished in Australia that I believe is 10 or 11. ||| 倫敦有一幢九層高嘅木製樓 澳洲都有一座新嘅木製樓 大概十至十一層樓高 
 And I believe the race is ultimately on. ||| 我相信呢場競爭終有一日會開始 
 Thank you. ||| 多謝 
 Welcome to Doha. ||| 歡迎大家蒞臨多哈 
 I am in charge of making this country's food secure. ||| 我嘅工作係負責卡塔爾嘅食品安全 
 That is my job for the next two years, to design an entire master plan, and then for the next 10 years to implement it — of course, with so many other people. ||| 將嚟兩年內 我將要規劃整個主項目 並喺後續嘅十年中付諸實施 梗，係同許多同事兼埋完成 
 But first, I need to talk to you about a story, which is my story, about the story of this country that you're all here in today. ||| 但首先，我想同大家分享一個我自己嘅故仔 呢個故仔便發生喺各位所在嘅個國家 
 And of course, most of you have had three meals today, and probably will continue to have after this event. ||| 在座嘅大多數今日應都已經食過三餐 或許喺活動之後仲會繼續 
 So going in, what was Qatar in the 1940s? ||| 但係，二十世紀四十年代嘅卡塔爾是乜嘢樣嘅 
 We were about 11,000 people living here. ||| 大槩有 11,000 人口 
 There was no water. There was no energy, no oil, no cars, none of that. ||| 冇飲用水、冇能源、冇石油、冇汽車…冇都沒有 
 Most of the people who lived here either lived in coastal villages, fishing, or were nomads who roamed around with the environment trying to find water. ||| 喺度生活嘅大多數人 抑或喺海邊邨莊打漁為生 抑或四處流浪尋揾水源 
 None of the glamour that you see today existed. ||| 宜家大家所見嘅迷人景緻喺當時仲未存喺 
 No cities like you see today in Doha or Dubai or Abu Dhabi or Kuwait or Riyadh. ||| 多哈、迪拜、阿佈紥比、科威特或利雅得亦都喺此列 
 It wasn't that they couldn't develop cities. ||| 並非係人哋唔願建設城市 
 Resources weren't there to develop them. ||| 而係事関資源匱乏 
 And you can see that life expectancy was also short. ||| 眾所週知，當時嘅壽命預期亦有限 
 Most people died around the age of 50. ||| 大多數人喺 50 歲左右過身 
 So let's move to chapter two: the oil era. ||| 隨著時光推移，我哋進入第二時期：石油時代 
 1939, that's when they discovered oil. ||| 1939 年，當時嘅人哋首次發現咗石油 
 But unfortunately, it wasn't really fully exploited commercially until after the Second World War. ||| 但遺憾嘅係，直到二戰之前 石油仲未得到全面商業開採 
 What did it do? ||| 那麼， 石油到底起到多大作用？ 
 It changed the face of this country, as you can see today and witness. ||| 顯然如各位所見，牠變左呢個國家嘅面口 
 It also made all those people who roamed around the desert — looking for water, looking for food, trying to take care of their livestock — urbanize. ||| 佢亦令喺沙漠中流浪嘅 尋揾水源咊食物嘅遊民 轉而起手関註其生活嘅必需品——城市化 
 You might find this strange, but in my family we have different accents. ||| 大家或者會覺得奇恠 但喺我嘅家族，家人間嘅聲痰尚唔盡相同 
 My mother has an accent that is so different to my father, and we're all a population of about 300,000 people in the same country. ||| 我嘅母親便與我嘅父親聲痰千差萬別 喺呢個人口 30 萬嘅國家 
 There are about five or six accents in this country as I speak. ||| 宜家卻有五六種唔同聲痰流行 
 "Someone says, ""How so? How could this happen?"" Because we lived scattered." ||| 有人會問點解？ 査實係事關我哋居住嘅好零散 
 We couldn't live in a concentrated way simply because there was no resources. ||| 我哋之前冇可能集中居住，事関生活資源並唔集中 
 And when the resources came, be it oil, we started building these fancy technologies and bringing people together because we needed the concentration. ||| 而當資源，即係石油，豐富嘅時候 我哋便起手發展先進技術 並因發展所需，將人哋集中起嚟 
 People started to get to know each other. ||| 之前喺唔同地區嘅人哋起手瞭解彼此 
 And we realized that there are some differences in accents. ||| 而此時大家發現彼此嘅聲痰經已大唔相同 
 So that is the chapter two: the oil era. ||| 以上就係石油時代嘅情況 
 Let's look at today. ||| 宜家我哋嚟関註當下 
 This is probably the skyline that most of you know about Doha. ||| 呢大槩係今日人哋所熟知嘅多哈天際綫 
 So what's the population today? ||| 如今嘅人口數目點呢？ 
 It's 1.7 million people. ||| 經已係 170 萬人嘅大都市 
 That is in less than 60 years. ||| 而時間僅僅過去 60 年 
 The average growth of our economy is about 15 percent for the past five years. ||| 過去五年嘅經濟拉勻增長率為 15% 
 Lifespan has increased to 78. ||| 壽命預期亦都提高至 78 歲 
 Water consumption has increased to 430 liters. ||| 人均用水量已升至 430 升 
 And this is amongst the highest worldwide. ||| 処於世界最高水平 
 From having no water whatsoever to consuming water to the highest degree, higher than any other nation. ||| 從水資源極其匱乏 到用水量達世界最高 
 I don't know if this was a reaction to lack of water. ||| 我唔知係咪應稱其為“物極必反” 
 But what is interesting about the story that I've just said? ||| 之唔過呢個故仔中最盞鬼嘅係乜嘢呢？ 
 The interesting part is that we continue to grow 15 percent every year for the past five years without water. ||| 最盞鬼嘅係過去五年連氣 15% 嘅經濟增長 係喺水資源嚴重匱乏嘅前提下實現嘅 
 Now that is historic. It's never happened before in history. ||| 呢喺歷史上係頭一同出現 
 Cities were totally wiped out because of the lack of water. ||| 歷史上，幾乎所有缺水嘅城市都終將被廢棄 
 This is history being made in this region. ||| 然而喺多哈，人哋卻改寫咗歷史 
 Not only cities that we're building, but cities with dreams and people who are wishing to be scientists, doctors. ||| 唔僅喺於我哋建設嘅城市 更喺於城市同居民嘅發展夢想，人哋睺住成為科學家或醫生 
 Build a nice home, bring the architect, design my house. ||| 睺住建設家園，請到建築師嚟設計自己嘅屋企 
 These people are adamant that this is a livable space when it wasn't. ||| 人哋嘅堅定與努力，使呢片唔毛之地變得宜居緐榮 
 But of course, with the use of technology. ||| 梗，一切都必須歸功於先進科技 
 So Brazil has 1,782 millimeters per year of precipitation of rain. ||| 巴西嘅年降雨量至到 1,782 毫米 
 Qatar has 74, and we have that growth rate. ||| 卡塔爾淨 74 毫米/年，卻同巴西經濟發展率持平 
 The question is how. ||| 問題喺於 
 How could we survive that? ||| 我哋係點取得呢一成就嘅？ 
 We have no water whatsoever. ||| 雖然我哋冇水資源 
 Simply because of this gigantic, mammoth machine called desalination. ||| 但我哋擁有好龐大嘅海水淨化裝寘 
 Energy is the key factor here. It changed everything. ||| 此時最主要嘅因素便係能源。能源改變咗一切 
 It is that thing that we pump out of the ground, we burn tons of, probably most of you used it coming to Doha. ||| 能源便係我哋從地底抽取並消耗嘅石油 査實情座絕大多數人能夠嚟到現塲亦都係靠佢 
 So that is our lake, if you can see it. ||| 所以，佢就似係我哋嘅湖泊 
 That is our river. ||| 同河流 
 That is how you all happen to use and enjoy water. ||| 事關有佢，大家至有淡水可用 
 This is the best technology that this region could ever have: desalination. ||| 對於呢度而言，海水淡化技術就係最偉大嘅技術 
 So what are the risks? ||| 但未嚟有冇風險？ 
 Do you worry much? ||| 係咪足以令人閉瞖？ 
 I would say, perhaps if you look at the global facts, you will realize, of course I have to worry. ||| 我想講嘅係，當我哋放眼全球 便會發現，呢種閉瞖並非多餘 
 There is growing demand, growing population. ||| 人口唔斷增長，對資源嘅需求亦都唔斷增長 
 We've turned seven billion only a few months ago. ||| 幾個月前，全球人口縂數經已爬頭 70 億 
 And so that number also demands food. ||| 隨之而嚟嘅便係對食物需求嘅增長 
 And there's predictions that we'll be nine billion by 2050. ||| 據預測，到 2050 年全球人口縂數將突破 90 億 
 So a country that has no water has to worry about what happens beyond its borders. ||| 對於一個冇水資源嘅國家嚟講 必須要攷慮未人嚟口增長帶嚟嘅負擔 
 There's also changing diets. ||| 呢一事實甚至變左人哋嘅飲食方式 
 By elevating to a higher socio-economic level, they also change their diet. ||| 隨著社會經濟水平嘅提高 人哋嘅飲食亦都隨之改變 
 They start eating more meat and so on and so forth. ||| 例如食用更多肉類等等 
 On the other hand, there is declining yields because of climate change and because of other factors. ||| 另一方面，事關氣候變化咊其佢原因 作物產量亦有減少 
 And so someone has to really realize when the crisis is going to happen. ||| 因此，人哋唔得唔面對危機確會到嚟嘅現實 
 This is the situation in Qatar, for those who don't know. ||| 呢就係卡塔爾嘅現狀 
 We only have two days of water reserve. ||| 我哋嘅淡水儲備僅夠使用兩日 
 We import 90 percent of our food, and we only cultivate less than one percent of our land. ||| 我哋 90% 嘅食物都依賴進口 我哋亦衹開發咗 1% 嘅囯土面積 
 The limited number of farmers that we have have been pushed out of their farming practices as a result of open market policy and bringing the big competitions, etc., etc. ||| 我哋為數唔多嘅農業勞力 亦都因市襍開放政筞同引進大宗生產競爭等原因 而唔再從事農業生產 
 So we also face risks. ||| 所以講，危機係嘅嘅確確存喺嘅 
 These risks directly affect the sustainability of this nation and its continuity. ||| 呢啲危機都直頭影響著呢個國家嘅穩定與延續 
 The question is, is there a solution? ||| 鬼咁，有乜解決方案呢？ 
 Is there a sustainable solution? ||| 有冇一種可持續嘅解決方案？ 
 Indeed there is. ||| 答案係實穩嘅 
 This slide sums up thousands of pages of technical documents that we've been working on over the past two years. ||| 呢份幻燈片縂結咗數千頁嘅技術文件內容 都係我哋近兩年嚟嘅工作成果 
 Let's start with the water. ||| 我先從水資源部分起手撦綫 
 So we know very well — I showed you earlier — that we need this energy. ||| 之前我哋經已明確，我哋確需但缺乏水資源 
 So if we're going to need energy, what sort of energy? ||| 牠屬於邊種資源？ 
 A depletable energy? Fossil fuel? ||| 係唔得再生資源咩？譬如化石燃料？ 
 Or should we use something else? ||| 一係我哋可以用其佢資源嚟代鄧？ 
 Do we have the comparative advantage to use another sort of energy? ||| 假使我哋使用其佢鄧代資源，係咪存喺比較性嘅優勢？ 
 I guess most of you by now realize that we do: 300 days of sun. ||| 我斷估大多數人都想到咗太陽能。冇錯，呢度全年晴日日數高達 300 日，太陽能充足 
 And so we will use that renewable energy to produce the water that we need. ||| 所以，我哋要設灋將太陽能呢一可再生資源轉化成水資源 
 And we will probably put 1,800 megawatts of solar systems to produce 3.5 million cubic meters of water. ||| 為此我哋將裝備 180 萬千瓦嘅太陽能系統 嚟製造 350 萬立方米嘅淡水 
 And that is a lot of water. ||| 呢都唔係個細數 
 That water will go then to the farmers, and the farmers will be able to water their plants, and they will be able then to supply society with food. ||| 呢啲淡水將被分配畀農民 用嚟灌溉農作物 並進而為社會提供所需嘅食物 
 But in order to sustain the horizontal line — because these are the projects, these are the systems that we will deliver — we need to also develop the vertical line: system sustenance, high-level education, research and development, industries, technologies, to produce these technologies for application, and finally markets. ||| 但係，為咗保持項目嘅「水平綫」 事関要顧忌其佢嘅項目同系統 我哋還需要發展項目嘅各條“垂直綫” 包括系統延續、高等教育、科研發展 以及工業、科技等，以製齣適於應用並卒之適應市襍化運營嘅技術 
 But what gels all of it, what enables it, is legislation, policies, regulations. ||| 要把呢啲因素有効結閤喺兼埋、並確保其發揮作用就必須得到立法、政策同規範嘅保障 
 Without it we can't do anything. ||| 冇咗呢啲保障，一切都衹係空談 
 So that's what we are planning to do. ||| 呢也正係我哋計劃之中嘅工作 
 Within two years we should hopefully be done with this plan and taking it to implementation. ||| 順灘嘅話，成個規劃方案將喺兩年內完成 然之後順灘投入實施 
 Our objective is to be a millennium city, just like many millennium cities around: Istanbul, Rome, London, Paris, Damascus, Cairo. ||| 我哋嘅目標係建成一個可以屹立千年嘅城市，如同 伊斯坦堡、羅馬、倫敦、大馬士革以及開羅一樣 
 We are only 60 years old, but we want to live forever as a city, to live in peace. ||| 我哋雖然淨 60 年嘅歷史，但我哋希朢佢能夠永存 一城之邦，靜水流長 
 Thank you very much. ||| 多謝 
 (Applause) ||| （掌聲） 
 So for the past year and a half, my team at Push Pop Press and Charlie Melcher and Melcher Media have been working on creating the first feature-length interactive book. ||| 在過去嘅一年半時間， 我哋在Push Pop Press (一間數碼出版平台)團隊 連同查理·梅爾切以及梅爾切媒體公司 共同合作創造 第一本長篇互動電子書。 
 "It's called ""Our Choice"" and the author is Al Gore." ||| 書名為“我們的選擇” 作者係艾爾·高爾(前美國副總統） 
 "It's the sequel to ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" and it explores all the solutions that will solve the climate crisis." ||| "此書為""難以忽略的真相""之續作 並探討各種可能 解決氣候危機嘅方案。" 
 The book starts like this. This is the cover. ||| 黎本書開頭係咁。黎個係封面。 
 As the globe spins, we can see our location, and we can open the book and swipe through the chapters to browse the book. ||| 跟住個地球會轉， 我哋可以睇到所處嘅位置。 跟住，我哋打開本書 掃過各篇章節 來瀏覽此書 
 Or, we can scroll through the pages at the bottom. ||| 或者,我哋可以滑動書面底部進行翻頁。 
 And if we wanted to zoom into a page, we can just open it up. ||| 假如我哋想要縮放頁面， 可以直接咁樣打開。 
 And anything you see in the book, you can pick up with two fingers and lift off the page and open up. ||| 你係黎本書睇得到嘅野， 都可以用兩隻手指抓取 之後將其抽離頁面， 再打開。 
 And if you want to go back and read the book again, you just fold it back up and put it back on the page. ||| 如果你想返回 再讀一次， 只要將本書折埋再放翻頁面。 
 And so this works the same way; you pick it up and pop it open. ||| 用同一樣嘅方式；將圖片抽離，之後打開， 
 (Audio) Al Gore: I consider myself among the majority who look at windmills and feel they're a beautiful addition to the landscape. ||| (音效)艾爾·高爾: 我將我自己 歸類於大部分人一樣 睇到風車都會感到 他們為已有噶景觀錦上添花。 
 Mike Matas: And so throughout the whole book, Al Gore will walk you through and explain the photos. ||| 麥克·馬塔斯：總攬全書， 艾爾·高爾會為你導航解釋相片細節。 
 This photo, you can you can even see on an interactive map. ||| 黎張相片，你甚至可睇到一張交互地圖。 
 Zoom into it and see where it was taken. ||| 放大黎張地圖就可以睇到係邊度拍攝的。 
 And throughout the book, there's over an hour of documentary footage and interactive animations. ||| 在本書中， 有超過一個鐘頭嘅紀錄片 同埋交互動畫。 
 So you can open this one. ||| 譬如，你可以打開黎個。 
 (Audio) AG: Most modern wind turbines consist of a large ... ||| (音效) AG: 大部分現代風力渦輪機都具備大型... 
 MM: It starts playing immediately. ||| MM: 影片即刻播放。 
 And while it's playing, we can pinch and peak back at the page, and the movie keeps playing. ||| 播放果陣，我哋可以抽起影片之後又放翻頁面， 影片會繼續播放。 
 Or we can zoom out to the table of contents, and the video keeps playing. ||| 或者，我哋可以縮細翻目錄， 影片仍然繼續播放。 
 But one of the coolest things in this book are the interactive infographics. ||| 黎本書最型嘅其中一點 就係互動資料圖表。 
 This one shows the wind potential all around the United States. ||| 黎張圖表顯示出 美國各地嘅風力潛能。 
 But instead of just showing us the information, we can take our finger and explore, and see, state by state, exactly how much wind potential there is. ||| 唔淨至睇到黎D資訊， 我哋可以用手指去感觸探索， 觀看每一個州， 到底有幾多風力潛能。 
 We can do the same for geothermal energy and solar power. ||| 我哋可以用同樣方式去檢測地熱 和太陽能。 
 This is one of my favorites. ||| 黎張係我至愛之一。 
 So this shows ... ||| 你可以睇到... 
 (Laughter) (Applause) When the wind is blowing, any excess energy coming from the windmill is diverted into the battery. ||| (笑聲) (掌聲) 當起風時， 所有來自風車發電剩餘的能量 會被轉儲到電池中。 
 And as the wind starts dying down, any excess energy will be diverted back into the house — the lights never go out. ||| 隨著風漸漸平息， 所有多餘的能量將會轉移到住家 — (幹樣) 永遠唔會無電照明。 
 And this whole book, it doesn't just run on the iPad. ||| 黎本書，唔但只可以在iPad運行。 
 It also runs on the iPhone. ||| iPhone都可以用。 
 And so you can start reading on your iPad in your living room and then pick up where you left off on the iPhone. ||| 你可以安享家中客廳用iPad開始閱讀 之後再用iPhone繼續閱讀未剩餘部分。 
 And it works the exact same way. ||| 係iPhone都係用同樣嘅操作模式。 
 You can pinch into any page. ||| 你可以揀選起任何一頁。 
 Open it up. ||| 打開黎頁。 
 "So that's Push Pop Press' first title, Al Gore's ""Our Choice."" Thank you." ||| 所以黎個就係Push Pop Press出版嘅第一本書， 高爾嘅“我們的選擇”。 多謝。 
 (Applause) Chris Anderson: That's spectacular. ||| (掌聲) 克里斯·安德森:剛才實在太驚人了。 
 Do you want to be a publisher, a technology licenser? ||| 你係想成為一個出版商， 或係技術授權商？ 
 What is the business here? ||| 黎個係點樣嘅經營模式? 
 Is this something that other people can do? ||| 其他人都可以做同樣嘅產品嗎? 
 MM: Yeah, we're building a tool that makes it really easy for publishers right now to build this content. ||| MM:係嘅，我哋正在建立一個工具 可讓出版社非常簡易地建立書中內容。 
 So Melcher Media's team, who's on the East coast — and we're on the West coast, building the software — takes our tool and, every day, drags in images and text. ||| 可以咁講，梅爾切媒體嘅團度，距地位於(美國)東岸— 連同我哋係西岸嘅團隊，正在建立這套軟件— 利用我哋嘅工具 每日將圖片及文字編載入書中。 
 CA: So you want to license this software to publishers to make books as beautiful as that? (MM: Yes.) All right. Mike, thanks so much. ||| CA:所以， 你哋想將黎套軟件授權比出版社 來製造咁精美嘅圖書? (MM:係。) 好。麥克，多謝曬。 
 MM: Thank you. (CA: Good luck.) (Applause) ||| MM:多謝(CA:祝你好運。） (掌聲） 
 It's like you dipped a marble in water. ||| 就好似你將粒珠浸落水入面 
 They can handle a hurricane that comes and goes. ||| 佢地能夠駕馭來來往往嘅颱風 
 If you go to the site of the blowout, it looks pretty unbelievable. ||| 去到漏油嗰度嘅話 
 It looks like you just emptied the oil pan in your car, and you just dumped it in the ocean. ||| 望落就好似你將你架車嘅油底殼裡面啲油 倒晒落個海 
 signs of their outrage ... ||| 佢哋痛恨嘅跡象 
 There's a lot you can't see, also, underwater. ||| 仲有好多你見唔到嘅問題 
 I think it's being hidden on purpose. ||| 我覺得啲石油係故意被隱藏 
 These guys have to swim around through it. ||| 佢哋要喺附近游來游去 
 That guide's entire calendar year is canceled bookings. ||| 個導遊全年嘅預約 
 He has no bookings left. ||| 佢冇晒預約 
 That's the story of thousands of people. ||| 成千上萬嘅人都有同樣遭遇 
 These tuna swim the entire ocean. ||| 啲金槍魚游晒成個大西洋 
 They get in the Gulf Stream, they go all the way to Europe. ||| 嚟到墨西哥灣，跟住去歐洲 
 And that lower photo, that's a bird colony that has been boomed. ||| 喺下面張相，有片雀鳥棲息地被人裝埋輸油管 
 These birds make a living by diving into the water. ||| 啲雀鳥係靠潛落水底搵食物 
 But really, where are those birds going to get released to? ||| 但講真，啲雀鳥會被放去邊？ 
 So it's a continued fight. ||| 呢場係耐力戰 
 It's a historic moment right now. ||| 而家已經到咗歷史性時刻 
 Who says it's too expensive? ||| 邊個話大貴？ 
 But spacecraft measurements revealed a different story. ||| 但探測器做出嘅測量欲唔係想像中咁靚 
 That's hot enough to melt lead. ||| 佢嘅溫度足夠融咗鉛 
 The reality totally contradicted initial perceptions of this planet. ||| 現實同我哋最初對金星嘅想像係倒返轉 
 So that's more than 100 trillion miles. ||| 超過一兆英里 
 Ice on a planet's surface is also important for climate. ||| 星球表面嘅冰 係另一種決定氣候嘅重要因素 
 That's why the iceberg in this photo looks so blue. ||| 呢個就係點解呢幅圖嘅冰咁藍 
 And it's no surprise that this is my specialty. ||| 絕對唔係意外，呢個係我鑽研方向 
 Something is very challenging to me. ||| 雖然要畀朋友知道呢樣嘢係難 
 You can't just tell a one sided story. ||| 你唔可以只係話畀人知故事嘅其中一面 
 I'll give an example. China is a BRIC country. ||| 其中一個例子係：中國係金磚四國成員 
 BRIC country means Brazil, Russia, India and China. ||| 金磚四國即係巴西 俄羅斯、印度同中國 
 This emerging economy really is helping the revival of the world economy. ||| 呢幾個發展中國家嘅經濟增長 帶起全世界經濟復蘇 
 He said the SICK country means Syria, Iran, China and North Korea. ||| SICK 嘅國家包括敘利亞 伊朗、中國同北韓 
 The four countries have no access to Facebook. ||| 呢四個國家都禁止人民使用 Facebook 
 So basically, China is a SICK BRIC country. ||| 所以基本上中國係一個 SICK （英文有病之意）嘅金磚國家 
 It prevents weird things from the north. ||| 佢可以隔絕從北方而嚟嘅異物 
 In the north, there was a great wall, Chang Cheng. ||| 喺中國北面有一埲巨牆，叫長城 
 It protected China from invaders for 2,000 years. ||| 佢過去保護中國免受外族入侵 足足二千年 
 But China also has a great firewall. ||| 而今日嘅中國同樣有一道巨大嘅牆 ——防火長城 
 "So, basically the ""Internet"" has two Internets." ||| 所以，互聯網可以分為兩種： 
 One is the Internet, the other is the Chinanet. ||| 一個係「互聯網」 一個係「中國互聯網」 
 So today I want to upgrade it to 2.0 version. ||| 今日我想用第二種方法解釋 
 In China, we have 500 million Internet users. ||| 中國有五億網民 
 That's the biggest population of Netizens, Internet users, in the whole world. ||| 亦係全世界最大嘅網民人口 
 So even though China's is a totally censored Internet, but still, Chinese Internet society is really booming. ||| 就算點抑制互聯網都好 中國嘅網絡人口始終都會不斷澎漲 
 How to make it? It's simple. ||| 咁中國政府點算呢？好簡單 
 You have Google, we have Baidu. ||| 你哋有 Google，我哋有百度 
 You have Twitter, we have Weibo. ||| 你哋有 Twitter，我哋有微博 
 You have Facebook, we have Renren. ||| 你哋有 Facebook，我哋有人人網 
 You have YouTube, we have Youku and Tudou. ||| 你哋有 Youtube，我哋有優酷同土豆 
 That's not only to censor you. ||| 所以我認為呢啲先稱得上精嘅審查方法 
 Sometimes this Chinese national Internet policy is very simple: Block and clone. ||| 有時中國嘅互聯網政策非常簡單 就係封鎖，然後複製 
 On the one hand, he wants to satisfy people's need of a social network, which is very important; people really love social networking. ||| 政府一方面滿足 人民對於社交網絡嘅渴求 呢樣好重要，因為大家都好鐘意社交 
 He wanted to prevent the Netizens [from criticizing] him. ||| 佢想阻止網民批評佢 
 But once Netizens can't go online, they go in the street. ||| 但正正因為網民無得喺網上發聲 
 And now the result is very simple. ||| 依家結果非常明顯 
 But also, Ben Ali, Tunisian president, didn't follow the second rule. ||| 而突尼西亞總統班阿里 雖然冇阻止人上社交網 
 He allowed Facebook, a U.S.-based service, to continue to stay on inside of Tunisia. ||| 佢容許 Facebook 呢一個美國本土設立嘅網站 繼續喺突尼西亞營運 
 But those two very smart international censorship policies didn't prevent Chinese social media [from] becoming a really public sphere, a pathway of public opinion and the nightmare of Chinese officials. ||| 但係嗰兩個咁犀利嘅國際審查政策 都阻止唔到中國社交網絡 成為一個公開平台 畀網民有機會發表意見 
 Because we have 300 million microbloggers in China. ||| 中國有三億微博博客 
 It's the entire population of the United States. ||| 呢個數字其實就等於美國人口 
 So when these 300 million people, microbloggers, even they block the tweet in our censored platform. ||| 當我哋有呢三億微博博客 即使部分微博文章會被刪除 
 So it angered the Chinese Netizens. ||| 但咁嘅做法引起中國網民憤怒 
 He says it's good. It's good to go outside. ||| 中國政府話空氣質素好好 
 Why is Chinese social networking, even within the censorship, so booming? Part of the reason is Chinese languages. ||| 點解喺咁嚴密嘅審查之下 中國社交網絡仍然增長得咁快？ 部分原因係中文呢種語言嘅特性 
 It's the same content. One, you can see exactly one Chinese tweet is equal to 3.5 English tweets. ||| 中英文係同樣嘅內容 你可以清楚睇到一條中文微博嘅資訊量 等於 3.5 條英文貼文 
 Chinese is always cheating, right? ||| 中國人成日都作弊㗎啦 
 It became the media. ||| 佢變咗媒體 
 And even some of them were put into black jails. ||| 有啲甚至會被拉去坐監 
 But now we have Weibo, so I call it the Weibo petition. ||| 但係而家我哋有微博 
 They're almost like a national TV station. ||| 姚晨嘅微博簡直係一個全國性嘅電視台 
 If you — so a sad story will be picked up by her. ||| 如果你嘅故事俾佢睇中 
 It's so hard to post some sensitive words on the Chinese Weibo. ||| 要喺微博上講一啲敏感字 依然係非常困難 
 The grass-mud horse is caoníma, is the phonogram for motherfucker, the Netizens call themselves. ||| 草泥馬即係羊駝 同粗口「操你媽」發音非常相似 亦係網民對自己嘅稱呼 
 So that's kind of a caoníma versus the héxiè, that's very good. ||| 所以草泥馬同河蟹兩個名係絕配 
 But you can't even expand more, no, because Chinese Sina Weibo, when it was founded was exactly one month after the official blocking of Twitter.com. ||| 但係你唔可以走去解釋 因為中國嘅新浪微博係 喺中國封鎖 Twitter 啱啱一個月之後 出現嘅產物 
 Why? Because they have the data. ||| 點解？因為佢哋收到料 
 So they can use the 1984 scenario data mining of the dissident. ||| 佢哋可以用 1984 年 查異見者嘅方法去查你 
 (Laughter) You know, the server is in the [central] cats' hands, so even that — when the Netizens criticize the local government, the local government has not any access to the data in Beijing. ||| （笑聲） 大家都知道，中央貓控制住伺服器 所以即使網民喺網上批評地區政府 地區政府都無權取得儲存喺北京嘅資料 
 The server is in Beijing. ||| 而地方政府無能力接觸到啲資料 
 It's never happened before. ||| 同埋點解中央政府 當件事從來無發生過咁 
 So this kind of freedom is a targeted and precise window. ||| 所以呢次嘅自由係有目的同有限制 
 So Chinese in China, censorship is normal. ||| 所以喺中國 審查係一件再正常不過嘅事 
 Something you find is, freedom is weird. ||| 你會發現，自由真係好奇怪 
 Something will happen behind it. ||| 自由背後總會發生某啲事 
 So Weibo, the 300 million public sphere, became a very good, convenient tool for a political fight. ||| 所以擁有三十億用戶嘅微博公共空間 係一個既好用、又方便嘅政治鬥爭工具 
 But this technology is very new, but technically is very old. ||| 雖然社交科技好新 但係背後嘅概念仍然係舊 
 They just give them a target window to not censor people. ||| 佢哋只係需要唔審查人民就得嘞 
 So that's the update about this game, cat-and-mouse. ||| 以上就係貓捉老鼠遊戲嘅近況 
 Social media changed Chinese mindset. ||| 社交網絡改變咗中國人嘅思維 
 After all, we are the mouse. ||| 始終我哋都係老鼠 
 Whatever the future is, we should fight against the [cat]. ||| 無論未來係點，我哋都應該繼續抵抗貓 
 There is not only in China, but also in the United States there are some very small, cute but bad cats. ||| 並唔係淨係中國，美國都需要 因為美國都樣有啲 細細隻、可愛但係壞嘅貓 
 (Laughter) SOPA, PIPA, ACTA, TPP and ITU. ||| （笑聲） 禁止網絡盜版法案、保護知識產權法案 反假冒貿易協定 
 So my conclusion is very simple. ||| 所以我嘅結論好簡單 
 Don't let them hook [up] with the Chinese cats. ||| 唔好畀佢哋同中國貓有合作嘅機會 
 (Music) What you just heard are the interactions of barometric pressure, wind and temperature readings that were recorded of Hurricane Noel in 2007. ||| （音乐） 你刚刚听到嘅， 就系从2007年诺尔飓风中记低嘅 气压计,强风和温度嘅度数嘅协奏曲。 
 The musicians played off a three-dimensional graph of weather data like this. ||| 音乐家们演奏嘅其实系一个3D嘅音乐数据图，就好似呢果。 
 Every single bead, every single colored band, represents a weather element that can also be read as a musical note. ||| 每一粒珠子，每一条彩色线， 都代表佐一种天气元素， 亦代表佐一种音符。 
 I find weather extremely fascinating. ||| 我发现天气好有趣。 
 Weather is an amalgam of systems that is inherently invisible to most of us. ||| 佢系由我地大部分人都睇唔到嘅 各种系统构成嘅。 
 So I use sculpture and music to make it, not just visible, but also tactile and audible. ||| 所以，我用佐雕塑同音乐 来实现佢，令佢“可视”， 而且“可触”，“可听”。 
 All of my work begins very simple. ||| 我嘅工作嘅开始都好简单。 
 I extract information from a specific environment using very low-tech data collecting devices — generally anything I can find in the hardware store. ||| 我用很简易嘅方法， 来从特定环境入边抽取信息， 几乎所有工具都可以从五金店入边买到。 
 I then compare my information to the things I find on the Internet — satellite images, weather data from weather stations as well as offshore buoys. ||| 然后，我将我得到嘅呢地信息同我系网上稳到嘅—— 果地从气象站，海上浮标上得到嘅 卫星图像，天气数据信息进行对比。 
 That's both historical as well as real data. ||| 既有历史数据，亦有现实数据。 
 And then I compile all of these numbers on these clipboards that you see here. ||| 然后，我将呢地数字汇编系呢地写字板上面，就系你宜家睇到呢个。 
 These clipboards are filled with numbers. ||| 上面写满佐数字。 
 And from all of these numbers, I start with only two or three variables. ||| 由呢地数字出发， 我由两到三种变量开始。 
 That begins my translation process. ||| “翻译”过程开始啦。 
 My translation medium is a very simple basket. ||| 我嘅“翻译”介质就系一个好简单嘅竹篮。 
 A basket is made up of horizontal and vertical elements. ||| 一个篮，有横向同纵向嘅元素。 
 When I assign values to the vertical and horizontal elements, I can use the changes of those data points over time to create the form. ||| 当我赋予呢地横向、纵向嘅元素新嘅意义时， 我就可以用呢地随着时间变化嘅数据点， 来创造呢种艺术嘅形式。 
 I use natural reed, because natural reed has a lot of tension in it that I cannot fully control. ||| 我用天然芦苇， 因为天然嘅芦苇很有韧性， 我无法完全控制佢。 
 That means that it is the numbers that control the form, not me. ||| 呢个意味着，系呢地数据控制着形式， 而唔系我。 
 What I come up with are forms like these. ||| 我最终得到嘅就系好似呢地嘅形式。 
 These forms are completely made up of weather data or science data. ||| 呢地完全由天气数据或者系科学数据 构成嘅形式。 
 Every colored bead, every colored string, represents a weather element. ||| 每一粒彩珠，彩条， 代表佐一种天气元素。 
 And together, these elements, not only construct the form, but they also reveal behavioral relationships that may not come across through a two-dimensional graph. ||| 呢地元素系一起，唔单单建构出一种形式， 更建构佐一种两位空间 无法表达出嘅一种 元素间嘅行为关系。 
 When you step closer, you actually see that it is indeed all made up of numbers. ||| 你如果行近D，你会睇到 呢个完全系由数字搭建而成嘅。 
 The vertical elements are assigned a specific hour of the day. ||| 呢地垂直嘅元素 代表一日之内特定嘅时间。 
 So all the way around, you have a 24-hour timeline. ||| 所以，一圈代表佐24个小时。 
 But it's also used to assign a temperature range. ||| 不过佢亦都表示佐温度嘅范围。 
 On that grid, I can then weave the high tide readings, water temperature, air temperature and Moon phases. ||| 系呢上边，我可以加入涨潮嘅度数， 水温，气温同埋月相。 
 I also translate weather data into musical scores. ||| 我都将呢地天气数据转化成佐音符。 
 And musical notation allows me a more nuanced way of translating information without compromising it. ||| 乐谱呢种方式，俾佐我一种翻译信息 更细腻， 更无损嘅方式。 
 So all of these scores are made up of weather data. ||| 呢地乐谱都系由天气数据编成嘅。 
 Every single color, dot, every single line, is a weather element. ||| 每一种颜色，每一条线， 都系一种音乐元素。 
 And together, these variables construct a score. ||| 加埋一齐，呢地变量就构成佐一份乐谱。 
 I use these scores to collaborate with musicians. ||| 我同音乐家们合作演奏呢地乐谱。 
 This is the 1913 Trio performing one of my pieces at the Milwaukee Art Museum. ||| 佢地系“1913三重奏”， 演奏梗我一件被Milwakee 艺术博物馆 收藏嘅作品。 
 Meanwhile, I use these scores as blueprints to translate into sculptural forms like this, that function still in the sense of being a three-dimensional weather visualization, but now they're embedding the visual matrix of the musical score, so it can actually be read as a musical score. ||| 同时，我又以呢地乐谱为蓝本， 将佢地翻译成甘样嘅雕塑作品， 佢地一样可以发挥 令天气3D“可视化”嘅作用， 不过依家，佢地嵌入佐 音符嘅视觉形式， 所以佢可以好似乐谱一样被阅读。 
 What I love about this work is that it challenges our assumptions of what kind of visual vocabulary belongs in the world of art, versus science. ||| 正系因为佢挑战佐我地以前嘅假想， 即系对艺术同科学界内嘅可视语言嘅界定， 令我对佢喜爱有加。 
 This piece here is read very differently depending on where you place it. ||| 要点样睇呢件作品 取决于你将佢摆系边。 
 You place it in an art museum, it becomes a sculpture. ||| 如果你摆系博物馆入边，佢就系件雕塑。 
 You place it in a science museum, it becomes a three-dimensional visualization of data. ||| 摆系科学博物馆入边， 佢就变成佐一件3D可视嘅数据模型。 
 You place it in a music hall, it all of a sudden becomes a musical score. ||| 你将佢摆系音乐厅度， 佢突然间就会变成佐一份乐谱。 
 And I really like that, because the viewer is really challenged as to what visual language is part of science versus art versus music. ||| 我好中意呢个， 因为观者关于视觉语言嘅定义 被挑战佐， 系科学，艺术，定系音乐嘅一部分？（求指教~） 
 The other reason why I really like this is because it offers an alternative entry point into the complexity of science. ||| 我中意呢个嘅另一个原因， 就系佢提供佐另外一种 接近呢地复杂嘅科学嘅方法。 
 And not everyone has a Ph.D. in science. ||| 唔系所有人都系学自然科学嘅博士。 
 So for me, that was my way into it. ||| 对于我来讲，呢个就系我接近科学嘅方法。 
 Thank you. ||| 多谢。 
 (Applause) ||| （掌声） 
 I am a reformed marketer, and I now work in international development. ||| 我系一個改革營銷者 依家從事國際發展 
 In October, I spent some time in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is the [second] largest country in Africa. ||| 今年10月，我去咗剛果民主共和國 非洲（第二）最大嘅國家 
 In fact, it's as large as Western Europe, but it only has 300 miles of paved roads. ||| 事實上佢同西歐差唔多大 但築路長度只有300英里 
 The DRC is a dangerous place. ||| 剛果系一個危險的地方 
 In the past 10 years, five million people have died due to a war in the east. ||| 過去10年，已有五百萬人喪生係 東部嘅戰亂之中 
 But war isn't the only reason that life is difficult in the DRC. ||| 但導致人民生活困難嘅 並非只有戰爭 
 There are many health issues as well. ||| 仲有好多健康問題 
 In fact, the HIV prevalence rate is 1.3 percent among adults. ||| 事實上，係成年人中 HIV感染率系1.3% 
 This might not sound like a large number, but in a country with 76 million people, it means there are 930,000 that are infected. ||| 聽上去唔算多 但係一個有7千6百萬人口嘅國家 呢個數字就表示有93萬人受到感染 
 And due to the poor infrastructure, only 25 percent of those are receiving the life-saving drugs that they need. ||| 由於公共設施落後 只有25%嘅患者 獲得賴以生存嘅藥物 
 Which is why, in part, donor agencies provide condoms at low or no cost. ||| 呢個亦系捐贈機構 以低價或免費提供安全套嘅 部分原因 
 And so while I was in the DRC, I spent a lot of time talking to people about condoms, including Damien. ||| 所以係剛果期間 我花咗大量時間同居民談論安全套 包括狄米恩 
 Damien runs a hotel outside of Kinshasa. ||| 狄米恩係金沙薩周邊經營酒店 
 It's a hotel that's only open until midnight, so it's not a place that you stay. ||| 佢間酒店淨系開到午夜 所以唔系用嚟過夜嘅 
 But it is a place where sex workers and their clients come. ||| 性工作者同佢地嘅客人系呢度嘅常客 
 Now Damien knows all about condoms, but he doesn't sell them. ||| 狄米恩好瞭解安全套 但系佢唔賣 
 He said there's just not in demand. ||| 佢話根本冇人買 
 It's not surprising, because only three percent of people in the DRC use condoms. ||| 咁唔出奇 因為係剛果，只有3%嘅人 使用安全套 
 Joseph and Christine, who run a pharmacy where they sell a number of these condoms, said despite the fact that donor agencies provide them at low or no cost, and they have marketing campaigns that go along with them, their customers don't buy the branded versions. ||| 約瑟同克莉絲汀 佢地開嘅藥鋪有賣安全套 佢地話雖然捐贈機構提供咗廉價甚至免費嘅安全套 仲做咗相應嘅宣傳 但客人都唔買呢啲有牌子嘅 
 They like the generics. ||| 反而鐘意冇牌子個啲 
 And as a marketer, I found that curious. ||| 作為營銷者，我覺得好奇怪 
 And so I started to look at what the marketing looked like. ||| 於是我開始研究佢地嘅營銷策略 
 And it turns out that there are three main messages used by the donor agencies for these condoms: fear, financing and fidelity. ||| 結果發現捐贈機構嘅安全套廣告 主要包含三種信息 恐懼，經濟同忠誠 
 "They name the condoms things like Vive, ""to live"" or Trust." ||| 安全套嘅名包括“生命萬歲” 同“信任” 
 They package it with the red ribbon that reminds us of HIV, put it in boxes that remind you who paid for them, show pictures of your wife or husband and tell you to protect them or to act prudently. ||| 佢哋用印有紅絲帶包裝 見到就會諗起HIV 放係箱入面提醒你邊個系供應者 又印有妻子或丈夫的照片 提醒你要保護配偶 或謹慎行動 
 Now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about just before they go get a condom. ||| 呢啲都唔系一個人購買安全套之前 所諗嘅嘢 
 (Laughter) What is it that you think about just before you get a condom? ||| （笑聲） 你係買安全套之前 會諗啲乜嘢？ 
 Sex! ||| 性！ 
 And the private companies that sell condoms in these places, they understand this. ||| 係呢度銷售安全套嘅私營公司 瞭解呢一點 
 Their marketing is slightly different. ||| 佢地嘅宣傳策略有所不同 
 The name might not be much different, but the imagery sure is. ||| 名稱可能差唔多 但包裝就差好遠 
 Some brands are aspirational, and certainly the packaging is incredibly provocative. ||| 有啲牌子雄心勃勃 包裝極具誘惑 
 And this made me think that perhaps the donor agencies had just missed out on a key aspect of marketing: understanding who's the audience. ||| 於是我諗到 可能捐贈機構冇捉住 市場營銷嘅一個重點 就系要認清客戶群 
 And for donor agencies, unfortunately, the audience tends to be people that aren't even in the country they're working [in]. ||| 對於捐贈機構嚟講，好不幸 佢地嘅客戶 並唔系佢地所幫助嘅國家嘅人 
 It's people back home, people that support their work, people like these. ||| 而系佢地嘅同胞 系支持佢地工作嘅人 類似呢啲 
 But if what we're really trying to do is stop the spread of HIV, we need to think about the customer, the people whose behavior needs to change — the couples, the young women, the young men — whose lives depend on it. ||| 但系如果我地真正要做嘅 系阻止HIV嘅傳播 我地就要考慮到客戶 個啲行為需要做出改變嘅人 包括夫妻 年輕女子，年輕男子 呢點關係到佢地嘅生命安全 
 And so the lesson is this: it doesn't really matter what you're selling; you just have to think about who is your customer, and what are the messages that are going to get them to change their behavior. ||| 我地學到嘅教訓就系 你賣乜嘢唔緊要 但你要思考邊個系你嘅客戶 你要傳遞乜嘢信息 嚟令到佢地改變行為模式 
 It might just save their lives. ||| 咁樣可能會救佢地一命 
 Thank you. ||| 多謝 
 (Applause) ||| （掌聲） 
 Her doctor was called Alois. ||| 佢嘅醫生係 Alois 
 If Auguste had instead been alive today, we could offer her no more help than Alois was able to 114 years ago. ||| 如果 Auguste 今日仍然在世 我哋同 114 年前 Alois 可以幫佢做嘅嘢一樣不多 
 Alois was Dr. Alois Alzheimer. ||| Alois 就係 Alois Alzheimer醫生 
 Since 1901, medicine has advanced greatly. ||| 自從 1901 年以黎 
 But we've made essentially no progress at all in treating Alzheimer's disease. ||| 但係對於治療阿茲海默症 
 So I think about this all the time. ||| 所以我成日都諗住呢樣嘢 
 One out of every five Medicare dollars get spent on Alzheimer's. ||| 聯邦醫療保險裏面每五蚊嘅支出 
 Today, of the top 10 causes of death worldwide, Alzheimer's is the only one we cannot prevent, cure or even slow down. ||| 今時今日全世界最多人死亡嘅十個原因 只有阿茲海默症係唔能夠預防 醫好或者推遲惡化 
 For almost a century, we didn't know much about these. ||| 過咗差唔多一個世紀 
 And when it folds correctly, these sticky bits end up on the inside. ||| 如果摺得正確，啲點會喺紙嘅入邊 
 But sometimes things go wrong, and some sticky bits are on the outside. ||| 但有時摺錯，啲點就會喺出面 
 That's what we see in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. ||| 阿茲海默病人嘅腦部就係咁樣 
 There are many steps, and identifying which step to try to block is complex — like defusing a bomb. ||| 但係裏邊有好多個步驟 好似喺拆彈一樣 
 Cutting one wire might do nothing. ||| 剪一條電線可能拆唔到彈 
 Now let me show you some of our latest results. ||| 宜家就由我帶你哋睇下 
 No one outside of our lab has seen these yet. ||| 實驗室出面嘅人都從來未睇過 
 And you can see they're clearly sick. ||| 好清楚睇到佢哋係病咗 
 That was essential for advancing treatment for HIV in the late 1980s. ||| 呢樣對於八十年代後期 
 Today, we see that same drive to beat cancer. ||| 今日見到同樣一股動力去對抗癌症 
 So, it really is down to you. ||| 所以宜家真係靠你哋 
 Alzheimer's isn't, for the most part, a genetic disease. ||| 阿茲海默症對大多數人嚟講 都唔係一個遺傳病 
 Thank you. ||| 多謝 
 Hi there. I'm Hasan. I'm an artist. ||| 大家好，我叫哈桑，系一個藝術家 
 "And usually when I tell people I'm an artist, they just look at me and say, ""Do you paint?"" or ""What kind of medium do you work in?"" Well most of my work that I work with is really a little bit about methodologies of working rather than actually a specific discipline or a specific technique." ||| 通常我咁樣講 大家會望住我問：“你系畫畫噶？” 或者“你從事邉方面嘅藝術？” 其實我做嘅大部分工作 都系同工作方法論有關 而唔系具體某一種學科 或者某一種技術 
 So what I'm really interested in is creative problem solving. ||| 我所感興趣嘅系用創意方式解決問題 
 And I had a little bit of a problem a few years ago. ||| 而且幾年前我的確遇到少少問題 
 So let me show you a little of that. ||| 等我講畀你聽 
 So it started over here. ||| 事情發生系呢度 
 And this is the Detroit airport in June 19th of 2002. ||| 底特律機場，2002年六月19號 
 I was flying back to the U.S. from an exhibition overseas. ||| 我參加完一個海外展覽準備飛返美國 
 "And as I was coming back, well I was taken by the FBI, met by an FBI agent, and went into a little room and he asked me all sorts of questions — ""Where were you? What were you doing? Who were you talking with?" ||| 就嚟要飛嘅時候 被FBI帶走，去見一個FBI探員 行入一間細房 他問咗我各種各樣嘅問題 “你係邊度？做咗乜嘢？同邊個講過嘢？ 
 "Why were you there? Who pays for your trips?"" — all these little details." ||| “點解要去個度？邊個出旅費？” 乜都問 
 "And then literally just out of nowhere, the guy asks me, ""Where were you September 12th?"" And when most of us get asked, ""Where were you September 12th?"" or any date for that fact, it's like, ""I don't exactly remember, but I can look it up for you."" So I pulled out my little PDA, and I said, ""Okay, let's look up my appointments for September 12th."" I had September 12th — from 10:00 a.m. to 10:30 a.m., I paid my storage bill." ||| 突然間毫無根據 佢問我：“九月12號你係邊度？” 大部分人被問到九月12號係邉 或者任何一日 都會話：“我唔系好記得，不過可以查下” 所以我就攞出我部PDA 我話：“我地睇下九月12號嘅行程” 九月12號，早上十點到十點半，交咗倉庫保管費 
 From 10:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., I met with Judith who was one of my graduate students at the time. ||| 十點半到12點，我同朱迪思見面，佢系我當時嘅一個研究生 
 From 12:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m., I taught my intro class, 3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., I taught my advanced class. ||| 十二點到下午三點，我教初級班 三點到六點，教高級班 
 ""Where were you the 11th?" "Where were you the 10th?"" ||| “你11號係邉？”“10號係邉？” 
 ""Where were you the 29th? the 30th?"" ||| “29、30號係邊？” 
 ""Where were you October 5th?"" ||| “十月五號咧？” 
 We read about six months of my calendar. ||| 我地翻閱咗我六個月嘅記錄 
 And I don't think he was expecting me to have such detailed records of what I did. ||| 佢大概估唔到我將每日行程 記得咁詳盡 
 But good thing I did, because I don't look good in orange. ||| 好彩我有記 因為我著橙色監等服唔好睇 
 "(Laughter) So he asked me — (Applause) ""So this storage unit that you paid the rent on, what did you have in it?"" This was in Tampa, Florida, so I was like, ""Winter clothes that I have no use for in Florida." ||| （笑聲） 佢問我 （掌聲） “你租呢個倉庫 “用來裝乜嘢？” 倉庫位於佛羅里達州坦帕市 我話：“裝我系佛羅里達唔著嘅冬裝 
 Furniture that I can't fit in my ratty apartment. ||| “同埋我間爛公寓裝唔落嘅傢俬 
 "Just assorted garage sale junk, because I'm a pack rat."" And he looks at me really confused and says, ""No explosives?"" (Laughter) I was like, ""No, no. I'm pretty certain there were no explosives." ||| “類似車庫大平賣個啲嘢 “因為我鐘意執垃圾” 佢非常疑惑咁望著我話：“冇爆炸物？” （笑聲） 我答佢：“冇啊，我可以肯定 
 "And if there were, I would have remembered that one."" And he's still a little confused, but I think that anyone who talks to me for more than a couple of minutes realizes I'm not exactly a terrorist threat." ||| “如果有的話，我實記得” 他仲系有啲迷惑 我諗任何人同我傾多幾句 都會知道我唔系恐怖份子 
 "And so we're sitting there, and eventually after about an hour, hour and a half of just going back and forth, he says, ""Okay, I have enough information here." ||| 所以我地就坐係個度 反反復複問答咗大概個半鐘 佢終於講：“得了，搜齊資料了 
 I'm going to pass this onto the Tampa office. They're the ones who initiated this. ||| “我會發送去坦帕辦公室，系佢地負責嘅 
 "They'll follow up with you, and we'll take care of it."" I was like, ""Great."" So I got home and the phone rings, and a man introduced himself." ||| “佢地會同你跟進，我地會處理好” 我話：“好極了” 我返到屋企電話就響了 一個男人介紹咗佢自己 
 Basically this is the FBI offices in Tampa where I spent six months of my life — back and forth, not six months continuously. ||| 呢度就系FBI係坦帕嘅辦公地點 我係個度六個月 系出出入入，唔系連續六個月 
 By the way, you folks know that in the United States, you can't take photographs of federal buildings, but Google can do it for you. ||| 順便講下，你地知道係美國 聯邦大樓系唔畀影相噶 但系Google可以幫你影 
 So to the folks from Google, thank you. ||| Google嘅夥計，多謝曬 
 (Applause) So I spent a lot of time in this building. ||| （掌聲） 我經常出入呢棟建築 
 "Questions like: ""Have you ever witnessed or participated in any act that may be detrimental to the United States or a foreign nation?"" And you also have to consider the state of mind you're in when you're doing this." ||| 佢地嘅問題包括 “你有否目睹或者參與任何 “可能對美國或者其他國家有害嘅行動？” 當你接受審問嘅時候，要考慮 自己嘅心情 
 You're basically face-to-face with someone that essentially decides life or death. ||| 因為基本上你對著嘅 系掌握生殺大權嘅人 
 Or questions such as — actually, during the polygraph, which was how it finally ended after nine consecutive of them — one of the polygraph questions was ... ||| 或者其他問題——其實係進行測謊嘅時候 我連續測過九次先確認清白 其中一個測謊問題系… 
 "well the first one was, ""Is your name Hasan?"" ""Yes."" "Are we in Florida?" "Yes." "Is today Tuesday?" "Yes."" ||| 第一個系“你系唔系叫哈桑？”“系” “呢度系唔系佛羅里達？”“系”“今日系唔系星期二？”“系” 
 Because you have to base it on a yes or no. ||| 因為你只可以回答系定唔系 
 "Then, of course, the next question is: "Do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States?"" ||| 當然，跟住落來嘅問題就系 “你系唔系屬於任何想要危害美國嘅組織？” 
 I work at a university. ||| 我係大學做嘢 
 "(Laughter) So I was like, ""Maybe you want to ask some of my colleagues that directly."" But they said, ""Okay, aside from what we had discussed, do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States?"" I was like, ""No."" So at the end of six months of this and nine consecutive polygraphs, they said, ""Hey, everything's fine."" I was like, ""I know. That's what I've been trying to tell you guys all along." ||| （笑聲） 於是我回答：“或者你可以直接問下我啲同事” 不過佢地話：“除咗之前講過個啲 “你系唔系屬於任何想要危害美國嘅組織？” 我回答：“唔系” 咁樣過咗六個月 測謊九次之後 佢地話：“一切正常” 我話：“我知，我一直都想話畀你地知 
 "I know everything's fine."" So they're looking at me really odd." ||| “我知我冇問題” 佢地奇怪咁望著我 
 "And it's like, ""Guys, I travel a lot."" This is with the FBI." ||| 我話：“夥計，我成日出差” 我同FBI講 
 "And I was like, ""All we need is Alaska not to get the last memo, and here we go all over again."" And there was a sincere concern there." ||| “你地最好連阿拉斯加都通知到 “唔好到時又嚟一次” 我系真系擔心 
 "And he was like, ""You know, if you get into trouble, give us a call — we'll take care of it."" So ever since then, before I would go anywhere, I would call the FBI." ||| 佢話：“如果你遇到麻煩 “打畀我地，我地會搞掂” 所以自此之後，我出發去第二度之前都會打畀FBI 
 "I would tell them, ""Hey guys, this is where I'm going. This is my flight." ||| 同佢地講：“老友，我要去呢度，航班號幾多 
 "Northwest flight seven coming into Seattle on March 12th"" or whatever." ||| “西北航空七號班機飛去西雅圖” “時間系三月12號”之類 
 A couple weeks later, I'd call again, let them know. ||| 幾個星期之後，我又會電話知會一聲 
 It wasn't that I had to, but I chose to. ||| 佢地冇叫我咁做，系我想咁做 
 "Just wanted to say, ""Hey guys." ||| 想話：“夥計 
 "Don't want to make it look like I'm making any sudden moves."" (Laughter) ""I don't want you guys to think that I'm about to flee." ||| “我唔想你地誤會我有乜嘢突然行動” （笑聲） “唔想你地以為我要走路 
 "Just letting you know. Heads up."" And so I just kept doing this over and over and over." ||| “講聲你地知，小心” 於是我就不斷不斷咁樣做 
 And then the phone calls turned into emails, and the emails got longer and longer and longer ... ||| 之後電話變咗電子郵件 電子郵件仲越寫越長 
 with pictures, with travel tips. ||| 帶埋相片 旅行貼士 
 Then I'd make websites. ||| 我識得做網頁 
 And then I built this over here. Let me go back to it over here. ||| 所以我整咗呢個網站，打開畀你地睇下 
 So I actually designed this back in 2003. ||| 系我2003年設計嘅 
 So this kind of tracks me at any given moment. ||| 可以睇到我每時每刻嘅行蹤 
 I wrote some code for my mobile phone. ||| 我寫咗個手機程序 
 Basically, what I decided is okay guys, you want to watch me, that's cool. ||| 基本上我嘅諗法系，你想監視我，冇問題 
 But I'll watch myself. It's okay. ||| 但我會監視我自己，唔緊要 
 You don't have to waste your energy or your resources. ||| 你唔需要浪費精力同埋人手 
 And I'll help you out. ||| 等我嚟幫你 
 So in the process, I start thinking, well what else might they know about me? ||| 係過程中，我開始思考，佢地對我仲有乜嘢瞭解？ 
 Well they probably have all my flight records, so I decided to put all my flight records from birth online. ||| 佢地可能掌握咗我全部飛行記錄 所以我決定將我從出世以來嘅飛行記錄放上網 
 So you can see, Delta 1252 going from Kansas City to Atlanta. ||| 你可以見到，Delta 1252 從堪薩斯飛去亞特蘭大 
 And then you see, these are some of the meals that I've been fed on the planes. ||| 你睇，呢啲系我食過嘅飛機餐 
 This was on Delta 719 going from JFK to San Francisco. ||| 呢個系Delta 719 從甘乃迪機場飛去三藩市 
 See that? They won't let me on a plane with that, but they'll give it to me on the plane. ||| 見到未？佢地唔畀我帶刀上飛機 但系佢地會係飛機上畀我一把 
 (Laughter) These are the airports that I hang out in, because I like airports. ||| （笑聲） 呢啲系我逛過嘅機場 因為我鐘意機場 
 That's Kennedy airport, May 19th, Tuesday. ||| 呢個系五月19號星期二係甘乃迪機場 
 This is in Warsaw. ||| 呢個系華沙 
 Singapore. You can see, they're kind of empty. ||| 星加坡，你可以見到，機場冇乜人 
 These images are shot really anonymously to the point where it could be anyone. ||| 呢啲圖片嘅攝影者 可以系任何人 
 But if you can cross-reference this with the other data, then you're basically replaying the roll of the FBI agent and putting it all together. ||| 但如果同其他數據互相參考 基本上你就系用FBI探員嘅方式 整理出頭緒 
 And when you're in a situation where you have to justify every moment of your existence, you're put in the situation where you react in a very different manner. ||| 如果你不得已 要證明自己每時每刻嘅行蹤 你可以用非常特別嘅方式嚟回應 
 "At the time that this was going on, the last thing on my mind was ""art project."" I was certainly not thinking, hey, I got new work here." ||| 我受到懷疑嘅個段時間 根本冇諗過“藝術項目” 我當然唔可能諗，好了，有工開了 
 But after going through this, after realizing, well what just happened? ||| 但經歷之後，諗通發生咗乜嘢之後 
 And after piecing together this, this and this, this way of actually trying to figure out what happened for myself eventually evolved into this, and it actually became this project. ||| 將各種細節砌埋一齊 用呢種方式自我探索成件事 最後慢慢演變 就成為咗呢個項目 
 So these are the stores that I shop in — some of them — because they need to know. ||| 呢啲系我幫襯過嘅一部分士多 因為佢地想知道我去過邉 
 This is me buying some duck flavored paste at the Ranch 99 in Daly City on Sunday, November 15th. ||| 我係呢度買過鴨醬 地點系達利市農場路99號 時間系11月15號星期日 
 At Coreana Supermarket buying my kimchi because I like kimchi. ||| 一家韓國超市 買緊泡菜，因為我鐘意食 
 And I bought some crabs too right around there, and some chitlins at the Safeway in Emoryville. ||| 仲係個邊買咗蟹 係愛莫利維爾嘅超市買咗豬腸 
 And laundry too. Laundry detergent at West Oakland — East Oakland, sorry. ||| 係西奧克蘭買咗洗衣液 系東奧克蘭，唔好意思 
 And then my pickled jellyfish at the Hong Kong Supermarket on Route 18 in East Brunswick. ||| 仲買過醃海蜇 地點系東布倫瑞克18大道上嘅香港超市 
 Now if you go to my bank records, it'll actually show something from there, so you know that, on May 9th, that I bought $14.79 in fuel from Safeway Vallejo. ||| 如果你點開我嘅銀行記錄 就會見到 系五月九號呢日 我係瓦列霍嘅超市入過$14.79嘅油 
 So not only that I'm giving this information here and there, but now there's a third party, an independent third party, my bank, that's verifying that, yes indeed, I was there at this time. ||| 所以唔單只系我係度提供信息 仲有第三方參與提供 獨立嘅第三方，即系我嘅銀行 可以證明我當時的確係個度 
 So there's points, and these points are actually being cross-referenced. ||| 所以有幾個點可以交叉對比 
 And there's a verification taking place. ||| 仲可以攞出證明 
 Sometimes they're really small purchases. ||| 有陣時只系買咗少少嘢 
 So 34 cents foreign transaction fee. ||| 譬如34美分嘅外匯手續費 
 All of these are extracted directly from my bank accounts, and everything pops up right away. ||| 呢啲全部系從我嘅銀行帳戶提取出來噶 可以一目了然 
 Sometimes there's a lot of information. ||| 有陣時信息好多 
 This is exactly where my old apartment in San Francisco was. ||| 譬如呢個系我係三藩市嘅舊公寓 
 And then sometimes you get this. ||| 有陣時系咁樣 
 Sometimes you just get this, just an empty hallway in Salt Lake City, January 22nd. ||| 有陣時系咁，鹽湖城嘅一條空走廊 一月22號 
 And I can tell you exactly who I was with, where I was, because this is what I had to do with the FBI. ||| 我可以話畀你知我當時係邊度同邊個一齊 因為FBI就系要呢啲信息 
 I had to tell them every little detail of everything. ||| 每件事嘅每個小細節都要話畀佢地知 
 I spend a lot of time on the road. ||| 我經常出街 
 This is a parking lot in Elko, Nevada off of Route 80 at 8:01 p.m. on August 19th. ||| 呢個系內華達艾爾科嘅一個停車場 係80號公路邉 時間系八月19號晚上8:01 
 I spend a lot of time in gas stations too — empty train stations. ||| 我仲經常去加油站入油，呢個系空嘅火車站 
 So there's multiple databases. ||| 所以我有多個資料庫 
 And there's thousands and thousands and thousands of images. ||| 包含成千上萬張照片 
 There's actually 46,000 images right now on my site, and the FBI has seen all of them — at least I trust they've seen all of them. ||| 我個網站依家有四萬六千張相 FBI已經全部睇過曬 至少我相信佢地睇過 
 And then sometimes you don't get much information at all, you just get this empty bed. ||| 有陣時信息少 譬如得張空床 
 And sometimes you get a lot of text information and no visual information. ||| 有陣時淨系得文字信息冇圖像 
 So you get something like this. ||| 譬如咁樣 
 This, by the way, is the location of my favorite sandwich shop in California — Vietnamese sandwich. ||| 呢個系我係加州最鐘意嘅三文治鋪 越南三文治 
 So there's different categorizations of meals eaten outside empty train stations, empty gas stations. ||| 我將信息分門別類 包括係出邊食嘅飯 空火車站，空加油站 
 These are some of the meals that I've been cooking at home. ||| 呢啲系我自己係屋企煮嘅飯 
 So how do you know these are meals eaten at home? ||| 點樣證明系係屋企？ 
 Well the same plate shows up a whole bunch of times. ||| 可以見到同一只碟出現好多次 
 So again, you have to do some detective work here. ||| 呢點需要你去觀察推理 
 So sometimes the databases get so specific. ||| 有啲資料庫非常特定 
 These are all tacos eaten in Mexico City near a train station on July fifth to July sixth. ||| 呢啲系我係墨西哥城食嘅粟米卷 係一個火車站附近 從七月五號到六號 
 At 11:39 a.m. was this one. ||| 中午11:39食嘅系呢個 
 At 1:56 p.m. was this one. At 4:59 p.m. was this one. ||| 呢個系下晝1:56食嘅，呢個系4:59食嘅 
 So I time-stamp my life every few moments. ||| 每隔一陣我就會幫我嘅生活印時章 
 Every few moments I shoot the image. ||| 隔一陣就影張相 
 Now it's all done on my iPhone, and it all goes straight up to my server, and my server does all the backend work and categorizes things and puts everything together. ||| 依家全部用iPhone搞掂 直接就可以上傳到我嘅服務器 服務器會進行後端工作 將信息分類放置 
 They need to know where I'm doing my business, because they want to know about my business. ||| FBI想知道我係邊度上廁所 因為佢地要瞭解我嘅行動 
 So on December 4th, I went here. ||| 12月四號我去咗呢度 
 And on Sunday, June 14th at 2009 — this was actually about two o'clock in the afternoon in Skowhegan, Maine — this was my apartment there. ||| 2009年六月14號星期日 大概下晝兩點 係緬因州斯科希根，係我嘅公寓入邉 
 So what you're basically seeing here is all bits and pieces and all this information. ||| 你依家見到嘅 系零零碎碎嘅信息 
 If you go to my site, there's tons of things. ||| 上我嘅網站仲可以見到好多其他嘢 
 And really, it's not the most user-friendly interface. ||| 講真，個界面唔系咁好用 
 It's actually quite user-unfriendly. ||| 應該話系幾難用 
 And one of the reasons, also being part of the user-unfriendliness, is that everything is there, but you have to really work through it. ||| 其中一個難用嘅原因 就系信息太全面了 讀起上來唔方便 
 So by me putting all this information out there, what I'm basically telling you is I'm telling you everything. ||| 我將呢啲信息放出來 基本上就系將我嘅所有嘢話畀你知 
 But in this barrage of noise that I'm putting out, I actually live an incredibly anonymous and private life. ||| 但系儘管我透露咗 好多信息 我嘅生活卻保持住高度隱蔽唔受打擾 
 And you know very little about me actually. ||| 外人其實對我知之甚少 
 And really so I've come to the conclusion that the way you protect your privacy, particularly in an era where everything is cataloged and everything is archived and everything is recorded, there's no need to delete information anymore. ||| 所以我得出咗結論 要保護私隱 尤其系係呢個時代，乜都有記載 乜都有存檔，有記錄 根本冇必要再刪除信息 
 So what do you do when everything is out there? ||| 當所有資料都曝光了，你應該點做？ 
 Well you have to take control over it. ||| 你應該掌握控制權 
 And if I give you this information directly, it's a very different type of identity than if you were to try to go through and try to get bits and pieces. ||| 主動提供資料 同被動任人搜集資料 系非常唔同噶 
 The other thing that's also interesting that's going on here is the fact that intelligence agencies — and it doesn't matter who they are — they all operate in an industry where their commodity is information, or restricted access to information. ||| 仲有一點非常有趣 就系情報機構 唔理系邉一個 佢地嘅運作原理相同 信息就系佢地嘅商品 或者系有限嘅獲取信息嘅權利 
 And the reason their information has any value is, well, because no one else has access to it. ||| 佢地嘅信息之所以有價值 系因為其他人冇權獲取 
 And by me cutting out the middle man and giving it straight to you, the information that the FBI has has no value, so thus devaluing their currency. ||| 我唔通過中間人 而系直接將信息畀你 咁樣FBI掌握嘅信息就毫無價值了 佢地嘅信息貨幣就貶值了 
 And I understand that, on an individual level, it's purely symbolic. ||| 我知道係個人層面 呢個純粹系象徵性做法 
 But if 300 million people in the U.S. ||| 但系如果係美國嘅三億人 
 started doing this, we would have to redesign the entire intelligence system from the ground up. ||| 都開始咁樣做 情報系統就必須要全部由頭 重新設計 
 Because it just wouldn't work if everybody was sharing everything. ||| 因為如果大家將信息全部攞出來分享，佢地就唔適用了 
 And we're getting to that. ||| 已經有呢種趨勢 
 "When I first started this project, people were looking at me and saying, ""Why would you want to tell everybody what you're doing, where you're at?" ||| 我啱啱開始呢個項目嘅時候 好多人同我講 “點解你要話畀大家知你係邊度做緊乜嘢？ 
 "Why are you posting these photos?"" This was an age before people were Tweeting everywhere and 750 million people were posting status messages or poking people." ||| “點解你要發呢啲相？” 當時社交網絡仲未興起 七億五千萬人 仲未開始發表狀態 或者係社交網打招呼 
 So in a way, I'm glad that I'm completely obsolete. ||| 從某種意義來講，我好開心我完全脫節 
 I'm still doing this project, but it is obsolete, because you're all doing it. ||| 我依家仲做緊呢個項目，但系已經過時了 因為你地都做緊同樣嘅事 
 This is something that we all are doing on a daily basis, whether we're aware of it or not. ||| 呢啲系我地大家日常都做噶 唔理你有冇意識到 
 So we're creating our own archives and so on. ||| 我地係度建立緊我地自己嘅檔案 
 "And you know, some of my friends have always said, ""Hey, you're just paranoid. Why are you doing this?" ||| 我有啲朋友成日話 “你諗太多了，點解要做埋曬啲無謂嘢 
 Because no one's really watching. ||| “又冇人真系會睇 
 "No one's really going to bother you."" So one of the things that I do is I actually look through my server logs very carefully." ||| “冇人會來煩你噶” 所以我做嘅其中一樣嘢 就系仔細查看我嘅服務器日誌 
 Because it's about surveillance. ||| 因為同監視有關 
 I'm watching who's watching me. ||| 我要睇下邊個係度監視我 
 And I came up with these. ||| 結果發現呢啲 
 So these are some of my sample logs. ||| 呢啲系部分抽樣日誌 
 And just little bits and pieces, and you can see some of the things there. ||| 只系好少一部分，你可以見到邊個來過 
 And I cleaned up the list a little bit so you can see. ||| 我精簡出一個列表畀你地睇 
 So you can see that the Homeland Security likes to come by — Department of Homeland Security. ||| 你可以見到國土安全局經常光臨 國土安全局 
 You can see the National Security Agency likes to come by. ||| 國家安全局都經常來 
 I actually moved very close to them. I live right down the street from them now. ||| 其實我搬咗去佢地附近，就係佢地條街下邊 
 Central Intelligence Agency. ||| 中央情報局 
 Executive Office of the President. ||| 總統執行辦公室 
 Not really sure why they show up, but they do. ||| 唔知點解，不過佢地真系來過 
 I think they kind of like to look at art. ||| 我諗系因為佢地鐘意藝術 
 And I'm glad that we have patrons of the arts in these fields. ||| 我好開心係呢啲部門有藝術愛好者 
 So thank you very much. I appreciate it. ||| 多謝你地，感激不盡 
 (Applause) Bruno Giussani: Hasan, just curious. ||| （掌聲） 布魯諾·朱撒尼：哈桑，好奇問一句 
 "You said, ""Now everything automatically goes from my iPhone,"" but actually you do take the pictures and put on information." ||| 你話依家信息系自動從你部iPhone放上網 但系相片同埋信息都要靠你來拍攝輸入 
 So how many hours of the day does that take? ||| 咁你一日要花幾多個鐘來做呢啲嘢？ 
 HE: Almost none. ||| 哈桑：幾乎唔使 
 It's no different than sending a text. ||| 影相上傳 同發短訊冇乜區別 
 It's no different than checking an email. ||| 就好似查郵箱 
 It's one of those things, we got by just fine before we had to do any of those. ||| 以前唔做呢啲嘢個陣日子照樣過 
 So it's just become another day. ||| 依家只不過多咗件事 
 I mean, when we update a status message, we don't really think about how long that's going to take. ||| 我地更新狀態嘅時候 根本唔會諗要使幾長時間 
 So it's really just a matter of my phone clicking a couple of clicks, send, and then it's done. ||| 其實只不過系係手機度按幾下 發送，搞掂 
 And everything's automated at the other end. ||| 網絡個邉就會自動整理了 
 BG: On the day you are in a place where there is no coverage, the FBI gets crazy? ||| 布魯諾：如果你去咗一個上唔到網嘅地方，FBI咪會發癲？ 
 HE: Well it goes to the last point that I was at. ||| 哈桑：就好似我最後講嘅 
 So it holds onto the very last point. ||| 有我最後出現嘅地點記錄就得了 
 So if I'm on a 12-hour flight, you'll see the last airport that I departed from. ||| 譬如我要飛12個鐘 我會上傳出發嘅機場信息 
 BG: Hasan, thank you very much. (HE: Thank you.) (Applause) ||| 布魯諾：哈桑，非常多謝你（哈桑：多謝） （掌聲） 
 My travels to Afghanistan began many, many years ago on the eastern border of my country, my homeland, Poland. ||| 好多好多年以前 我就以阿富汗為終點開始旅行。 旅程由我唧祖國， 波蘭唧東邊界開始。 
 I was walking through the forests of my grandmother's tales. ||| 我行過嫲嫲故仔入邊 唧森林。 
 A land where every field hides a grave, where millions of people have been deported or killed in the 20th century. ||| 我行過周圍都喺墓地唧地方； 喺果啲地方，喺20世紀 成千上萬唧人 被放逐或殺害。 
 Behind the destruction, I found a soul of places. ||| 但喺喺依啲災難之外， 我發現咗一片充滿靈魂唧土地， 
 I met humble people. ||| 我見到謙遜唧人， 
 I heard their prayer and ate their bread. ||| 我聽到佢哋唧祈禱， 我食佢哋食唧麵包。 
 Then I have been walking East for 20 years — from Eastern Europe to Central Asia — through the Caucasus Mountains, Middle East, North Africa, Russia. ||| 從東歐到中亞， 我行咗20年； 我穿過咗高加索山脈， 行過咗中東 北非 同俄羅斯。 
 And I ever met more humble people. ||| 我見到更多謙遜唧人， 
 And I shared their bread and their prayer. ||| 食佢哋唧麵包，聽佢哋唧祈禱。 
 This is why I went to Afghanistan. ||| 依個就喺我去阿富汗唧原因。 
 One day, I crossed the bridge over the Oxus River. ||| 有一日，我行過 奧克蘇斯河上條橋。 
 I was alone on foot. ||| 我獨自一人行走， 
 And the Afghan soldier was so surprised to see me that he forgot to stamp my passport. ||| 個阿富汗士兵見到我唧時候都好驚訝， 甚至唔記得喺我唧護照上蓋章， 
 But he gave me a cup of tea. ||| 但喺佢哋畀咗杯茶我。 
 And I understood that his surprise was my protection. ||| 我覺得 佢唧驚訝反而保護咗我。 
 So I have been walking and traveling, by horses, by yak, by truck, by hitchhiking, from Iran's border to the bottom, to the edge of the Wakhan Corridor. ||| 由阿富汗唧伊朗邊境， 到阿富汗底部唧瓦罕走廊， 我行過路，騎過馬， 撐過艇，仲搭過便車。 
 And in this way I could find noor, the hidden light of Afghanistan. ||| 就喺通過依啲方式， 我發現咗阿富汗神秘唧一面：努爾鎮。 
 My only weapon was my notebook and my Leica. ||| 我唯一唧武器 就喺我本筆記簿同我部相機。 
 I heard prayers of the Sufi — humble Muslims, hated by the Taliban. ||| 我聽到伊斯蘭教蘇菲派唧祈禱 見到謙遜唧穆斯林， 但系塔利班分子好憎佢哋。 
 Hidden river, interconnected with the mysticism from Gibraltar to India. ||| 仲有不為人知唧河流， 將從直布羅陀到印度 所有神秘唧嘢連接起身。 
 The mosque where the respectful foreigner is showered with blessings and with tears, and welcomed as a gift. ||| 喺清真寺，恭敬唧外國人 都受到保佑， 感到溫情， 當地人都當寶咁歡迎佢哋。 
 What do we know about the country and the people that we pretend to protect, about the villages where the only one medicine to kill the pain and to stop the hunger is opium? ||| 關於依個國家同人民 我哋知道幾多？ 我哋只喺假裝保護佢哋。 我哋又有幾瞭解啲鄉鎮？ 依度唯一止痛唧藥 唯一止餓唧食物 喺鴉片。 
 These are opium-addicted people on the roofs of Kabul 10 years after the beginning of our war. ||| 依啲戰爭10年後 喺喀布爾屋頂上 染上鴉片癮唧人。 
 These are the nomad girls who became prostitutes for Afghan businessmen. ||| 依啲喺遊牧民族唧女仔， 佢哋成為咗阿富汗商人唧性工具。 
 What do we know about the women 10 years after the war? ||| 戰爭10年後， 我哋對女性瞭解幾多？ 
 Clothed in this nylon bag, made in China, with the name of burqa. ||| 佢哋身上套住個中國製造唧 尼龍袋， 所謂唧穆斯林傳統波卡服裝。 
 I saw one day, the largest school in Afghanistan, a girls' school. ||| 有一日， 我見到阿富汗最大唧學校， 喺間女子學校。 
 13,000 girls studying here in the rooms underground, full of scorpions. ||| 有一萬三千個女仔 喺依度返學， 佢哋喺地面下一間房上課， 入邊周圍都喺蝎子。 
 And their love [for studying] was so big that I cried. ||| 但喺佢哋對學習唧熱愛 令我熱淚盈眶。 
 What do we know about the death threats by the Taliban nailed on the doors of the people who dare to send their daughters to school as in Balkh? ||| 我哋又知道幾多 果啲夠膽送自己個女去返學唧家長 受到幾多 阿富汗恐怖分子唧死亡恐嚇？ 
 The region is not secure, but full of the Taliban, and they did it. ||| 依個地區好危險，而且周圍都喺塔利班份子， 但喺啲女仔都讀到書。 
 My aim is to give a voice to the silent people, to show the hidden lights behind the curtain of the great game, the small worlds ignored by the media and the prophets of a global conflict. ||| 我想幫啲無辦法出聲唧人， 講出佢哋唧故仔， 展示佢哋不為人知唧一面； 展示喺依場遊戲唧帷幕后邊， 被媒體，被全球危機先知 所遺忘唧小小世界。 
 Thanks. ||| 多謝。 
 (Applause) ||| （掌聲） 
 What's in the box? ||| 個箱裏面有乜？ 
 Whatever it is must be pretty important, because I've traveled with it, moved it, from apartment to apartment to apartment. ||| 無論係乜，肯定好重要， 因為我去邊到都帶著佢， 從公寓到公寓再到另一公寓。 
 (Laughter) (Applause) Sound familiar? ||| （笑聲） （掌聲） 聽上去好熟？ 
 Did you know that we Americans have about three times the amount of space we did 50 years ago? ||| 你知道我哋美國人 比起50年前用多左 3倍多嘅空間？ 
 Three times. ||| 3倍啊。 
 So you'd think, with all this extra space, we'd have plenty of room for all our stuff. ||| 所以你會諗，多咗咁多空間， 我哋就有更多地方擺我哋嘅物品。 
 Nope. ||| 唔係。 
 There's a new industry in town, a 22 billion-dollar, 2.2 billion sq. ft. industry: that of personal storage. ||| 市鎮有個新嘅產業， 一個價值220億，佔地22億平方呎嘅產ｄ業： 用作個人存儲空間。 
 So we've got triple the space, but we've become such good shoppers that we need even more space. ||| 我們有多3倍嘅空間， 但係我哋就更喜愛購物 使到我哋需要更多嘅地空間。 
 So where does this lead? ||| 繼續咁樣落去會點？ 
 Lots of credit card debt, huge environmental footprints, and perhaps not coincidentally, our happiness levels flat-lined over the same 50 years. ||| 一堆信用卡債務， 巨大啲環境足跡， 或者唔係偶然地， 我們嘅幸福水平在過去50年來都係無變化嘅。 
 Well I'm here to suggest there's a better way, that less might actually equal more. ||| 咁我來提議一個更好嘅方法， 少些或者實際上等於多些。 
 I bet most of us have experienced at some point the joys of less: college — in your dorm, traveling — in a hotel room, camping — rig up basically nothing, maybe a boat. ||| 我打賭大部分人都曾經有過經歷 少些嘅喜悅： 在你大學宿舍裏， 在旅行中嘅酒店房間裏， 輕裝露營時， 或者在小船上。 
 Whatever it was for you, I bet that, among other things, this gave you a little more freedom, a little more time. ||| 無論係咩，其他嘢唔講，我估， 這些經歷多少俾到你更多自由。 更多時間。 
 So I'm going to suggest that less stuff and less space are going to equal a smaller footprint. ||| 咁我依家提議 少些物品和空間 會等同於少些環境足跡。 
 It's actually a great way to save you some money. ||| 實際上呢個方法仲可以幫你慳錢。 
 And it's going to give you a little more ease in your life. ||| 而且令你生活有多些悠閒。 
 So I started a project called Life Edited at lifeedited.org to further this conversation and to find some great solutions in this area. ||| 所以我係lifeedited.org發起左一個叫「簡約生活」計畫 嚟更深入深討我哋個話題 同埋係嚟到揾到啲好嘅解決方案。 
 First up: crowd-sourcing my 420 sq. ft. apartment in Manhattan with partners Mutopo and Jovoto.com. ||| 首先：在我在曼哈頓420平方呎嘅公寓裏 與穆特普與橋瓦特兩家公司合作。 
 I wanted it all — home office, sit down dinner for 10, room for guests, and all my kite surfing gear. ||| 我心頭大，乜都想要— 家庭辦公室，10個人嘅餐飲空間， 客房， 同埋我全部嘅風箏衝浪裝備。 
 With over 300 entries from around the world, I got it, my own little jewel box. ||| 來之全球300多個方案， 我終於揾到一個完美方案。 
 By buying a space that was 420 sq. ft. ||| 買一個420平方呎嘅地方， 
 instead of 600, immediately I'm saving 200 grand. ||| 而唔係600平方呎， 我立刻就慳左20萬。 
 Smaller space is going to make for smaller utilities — save some more money there, but also a smaller footprint. ||| 更細嘅空間就需更細嘅設備— 就係到慳左更多嘅錢， 而且更少環境足跡。 
 And because it's really designed around an edited set of possessions — my favorite stuff — and really designed for me, I'm really excited to be there. ||| 因為個地方係設計嚟 滿足曬我嘅需求—我最愛嘅物品— 專為找以設嘅， 我十分興奮搬入去。 
 So how can you live little? ||| 咁你點樣先可以過簡約嘅生活？ 
 Three main approaches. ||| 3個重點。 
 First of all, you have to edit ruthlessly. ||| 首先，你一定要決心去改。 
 We've got to clear the arteries of our lives. ||| 我哋一定要洗心革面。 
 And that shirt that I hadn't worn in years? ||| 好似個件我好多年都無著過嘅衫？ 
 It's time for me to let it go. ||| 係時候處理左佢。 
 We've got to cut the extraneous out of our lives, and we've got to learn to stem the inflow. ||| 我哋一定要除去生活中多餘繁瑣嘅， 同埋學會逆向思維。 
 We need to think before we buy. ||| 我哋要考慮過是否需要才去買。 
 "Ask ourselves, "Is that really going to make me happier? Truly?"" ||| 問下自己， “啲嘢會令我更開心幸福？真係？” 
 By all means, we should buy and own some great stuff. ||| 當然， 我哋應該買同擁有啲好嘢嘅。 
 But we want stuff that we're going to love for years, not just stuff. ||| 但係我地想要啲係我哋真係愛不惜手嘅嘢， 唔係啲是是但但嘅嘢。 
 Secondly, our new mantra: small is sexy. ||| 第二，我哋新嘅口頭禪： 細係性感嘅。 
 We want space efficiency. ||| 我哋要實用嘅空間。 
 We want things that are designed for how they're used the vast majority of the time, not that rare event. ||| 我哋要嘅嘢係設計為 長期使用， 唔係只係偶然需要。 
 Why have a six burner stove when you rarely use three? ||| 點解要6個火爐 當你極少時候會用3個？ 
 So we want things that nest, we want things that stack, and we want it digitized. ||| 所以我哋要將物品大小順序擺埋一齊， 我地想物品容易堆放，同埋係數碼化嘅。 
 You can take paperwork, books, movies, and you can make it disappear — it's magic. ||| 你可以將文件， 書籍，電影， 把這些東西消失—如同魔法一樣。 
 Finally, we want multifunctional spaces and housewares — a sink combined with a toilet, a dining table becomes a bed — same space, a little side table stretches out to seat 10. ||| 最後，我哋要多功能空間同家具—— 洗手盆兼馬桶， 飯臺變睡床—— 同一個空間， 一個摺枱 扯出10人飯枱。 
 In the winning Life Edited scheme in a render here, we combine a moving wall with transformer furniture to get a lot out of the space. ||| 在這個獲獎的簡約生活企劃中， 我哋利用可以變形嘅家具同埋可移動嘅牆 騰出好多空間。 
 Look at the coffee table — it grows in height and width to seat 10. ||| 睇下張咖啡枱— 佢可以拉高拉闊 可以座10個人。 
 My office folds away, easily hidden. ||| 我嘅工作室可以收起， 容易收埋。 
 My bed just pops out of the wall with two fingers. ||| 我用兩隻手指我張床就可以拉出嚟。 
 Guests? Move the moving wall, have some fold-down guest beds. ||| 客人點？推開個活動牆， 可以疊出幾張床。 
 And of course, my own movie theater. ||| 當然，仲有我嘅私人影院。 
 So I'm not saying that we all need to live in 420 sq. ft. ||| 我唔係話每個人都需要生活 在420平方呎裏。 
 But consider the benefits of an edited life. ||| 但係值得考慮下簡約生活的好處。 
 Go from 3,000 to 2,000, from 1,500 to 1,000. ||| 從3000到2000平方呎， 從1500到1000平方呎。 
 Most of us, maybe all of us, are here pretty happily for a bunch of days with a couple of bags, maybe a small space, a hotel room. ||| 我哋大部分人，或者所有人， 大多時候都可以很愉快 只需幾個睡袋， 或者一個細少嘅空間，一個酒店嘅房間。 
 "So when you go home and you walk through your front door, take a second and ask yourselves, ""Could I do with a little life editing?" ||| 咁當你回家踏入大門時， 不妨問下自己， “我可否過得簡約啲？ 
 Would that give me a little more freedom? ||| 咁樣會唔會俾到我更多自由？ 
 "Maybe a little more time?"" What's in the box?" ||| 或者更多時間？” 個箱到有咩？ 
 It doesn't really matter. ||| 其實有乜都唔重要。 
 I know I don't need it. ||| 我知道我用唔著。 
 What's in yours? ||| 你個箱到有乜啊? 
 Maybe, just maybe, less might equal more. ||| 或者，只是或者， 少啲就係等於多啲。 
 So let's make room for the good stuff. ||| 一起騰出更多嘅空間 俾美好嘅嘢。 
 Thank you. ||| 多謝。 
 (Applause) ||| (掌聲) 
 When I was 10 years old, a cousin of mine took me on a tour of his medical school. ||| 我十岁果阵时, 我有个表哥带我参观咗佢返学嘅医学院 
 And as a special treat, he took me to the pathology lab and took a real human brain out of the jar and placed it in my hands. ||| 我仲得到特殊照顾 佢带我去咗间病理学实验室 然后攞出个真实嘅人类大脑 从一个罐入边 然后摆喺我手上 
 And there it was, the seat of human consciousness, the powerhouse of the human body, sitting in my hands. ||| 呢个就喺 人类意识嘅位置 人体躯干嘅发动机 摆喺我手上 
 And that day I knew that when I grew up, I was going to become a brain doctor, scientist, something or the other. ||| 由果日开始 我知道我大个咗之後 我会去做一个脑科医生 或者喺科学家,或者其他相关嘅 
 Years later, when I finally grew up, my dream came true. ||| 过咗咁多年,当我终于大个女了 我嘅梦想实现咗 
 And it was while I was doing my Ph.D. ||| 然后当我修紧我嘅哲学博士学位 
 on the neurological causes of dyslexia in children that I encountered a startling fact that I'd like to share with you all today. ||| 喺关于对神经系统有問題 而造成阅读障碍嘅细路 我发现到一个惊人嘅事实 而今日我想将佢同大家分享下 
 It is estimated that one in six children, that's one in six children, suffer from some developmental disorder. ||| 据估计,六分之一嘅细路 每六个细路就有一个 会有某种程度嘅发展障碍问题 
 This is a disorder that retards mental development in the child and causes permanent mental impairments. ||| 呢种发展障碍 会阻住儿童嘅心智发展 并造成永久嘅精神损伤 
 Which means that each and every one of you here today knows at least one child that is suffering from a developmental disorder. ||| 即喺话今日在座嘅每一位½ 都会认识起码一位细路 喺有发展障碍嘅 
 But here's what really perplexed me. ||| 但喺有一度令我搞唔明嘅地方 
 Despite the fact that each and every one of these disorders originates in the brain, most of these disorders are diagnosed solely on the basis of observable behavior. ||| 尽管事实上 每个发展障碍嘅个案 都系产生喺大脑之中 基本上呢啲紊乱 都喺简单嘅通过 观察患者基本嘅行为嚟诊断 
 But diagnosing a brain disorder without actually looking at the brain is analogous to treating a patient with a heart problem based on their physical symptoms, without even doing an ECG or a chest X-ray to look at the heart. ||| 但喺诊断一种大脑紊乱 又唔去睇个大脑发生咩事 就好似医一个心脏病人 只根据简单嘅身体症状 而唔去睇心电图或者系X光胸透 嚟了解个心脏 
 It seemed so intuitive to me. ||| 我觉得咁太依赖直觉喇 
 To diagnose and treat a brain disorder accurately, it would be necessary to look at the brain directly. ||| 要精确诊断同医好一种大脑紊乱 绝对要直接睇下个大脑 
 Looking at behavior alone can miss a vital piece of the puzzle and provide an incomplete, or even a misleading, picture of the child's problems. ||| 只喺睇病人嘅行为 有可能错过最重要嘅一塊拼图 同埋导致不完全,甚至喺错误解读 问题解决方案 
 Yet, despite all the advances in medical technology, the diagnosis of brain disorders in one in six children still remained so limited. ||| 依家 尽管医疗科技进步咗好多 要诊断六分之一儿童嘅 大脑紊乱 条件都喺好有限嘅 
 And then I came across a team at Harvard University that had taken one such advanced medical technology and finally applied it, instead of in brain research, towards diagnosing brain disorders in children. ||| 后来我遇到一个哈佛大学嘅小组 佢哋用咗种好先进嘅医疗技术™ 并运用佢 唔单止做大脑研究 仲用佢诊断儿童嘅大脑紊乱问题 
 Their groundbreaking technology records the EEG, or the electrical activity of the brain, in real time, allowing us to watch the brain as it performs various functions and then detect even the slightest abnormality in any of these functions: vision, attention, language, audition. ||| 佢哋呢种创新嘅技术 可以记录EEG脑电图或者电流活动¾ 仲喺实时记录 咁样我哋就可以睇到 大脑执行不同嘅功能 然后检测出啲好细微嘅异常 喺呢啲功能之中 视觉,注意力,语言,发声 
 A program called Brain Electrical Activity Mapping then triangulates the source of that abnormality in the brain. ||| 有一个项目叫做 脑电活动绘图 用三角定位的方式找出 脑部唔正常信号嘅来源 
 And another program called Statistical Probability Mapping then performs mathematical calculations to determine whether any of these abnormalities are clinically significant, allowing us to provide a much more accurate neurological diagnosis of the child's symptoms. ||| 仲有一个项目叫做 统计几率绘图 佢可以执行数学运算 通过运算嚟决定呢啲反常 喺未临床特征 咁就比咗我哋一个更加之精准嘅 神经学诊断 对果啲儿童嘅症状 
 And so I became the head of neurophysiology for the clinical arm of this team, and we're finally able to use this technology towards actually helping children with brain disorders. ||| 所以我就做咗呢个团队 临床部分嘅神经生理学嘅负责人 同埋我哋依家终于可以用呢种科技 实实际际咁 去帮助大脑紊乱嘅小朋友 
 And I'm happy to say that I'm now in the process of setting up this technology here in India. ||| 喺呢度我好开心咁同大家讲我哋依家 正在将呢种科技应用到印度 
 I'd like to tell you about one such child, whose story was also covered by ABC News. ||| 我想同大家讲下一个小朋友 佢嘅故事美国广播公司都有介绍 
 Seven-year-old Justin Senigar came to our clinic with this diagnosis of very severe autism. ||| 七岁嘅 Justin Seingar 嚟到我哋诊所 佢被人哋诊断到有好严重嘅自闭症 
 Like many autistic children, his mind was locked inside his body. ||| 好似好多自闭症儿童咁 佢嘅心智被自己嘅身体鎖住咗 
 There were moments when he would actually space out for seconds at a time. ||| 曾经有几次 佢自己一个人喺度发牛斗 
 And the doctors told his parents he was never going to be able to communicate or interact socially, and he would probably never have too much language. ||| 个医生同佢父母讲 佢永远都唔可以 好似社交咁沟通同互动 佢可能永远唔会讲好多野 
 When we used this groundbreaking EEG technology to actually look at Justin's brain, the results were startling. ||| 当我哋用呢个创新嘅脑电图(EEG)科技 去认真睇下Justin嘅大脑 结果系好出乎意料嘅 
 It turned out that Justin was almost certainly not autistic. ||| 结果显示Justin基本 完全无自闭症 
 He was suffering from brain seizures that were impossible to see with the naked eye, but that were actually causing symptoms that mimicked those of autism. ||| 佢只系脑部疾病发作 而斋系用对眼系睇唔到嘅 但喺佢又喺会引起 好似自闭症咁嘅症状 
 After Justin was given anti-seizure medication, the change in him was amazing. ||| 当Justin接受咗抗发作药物治疗之后 佢嘅改变喺十分惊人嘅 
 Within a period of 60 days, his vocabulary went from two to three words to 300 words. ||| 喺60日嘅时间之内 佢嘅词汇从两三个单词 飞升到300几个 
 And his communication and social interaction were improved so dramatically that he was enrolled into a regular school and even became a karate super champ. ||| 佢嘅沟通同社交 不可思议嘅提升到 可以去正常嘅学校返学 佢甚至变成咗一个空手道嘅冠軍 
 Research shows that 50 percent of children, almost 50 percent of children diagnosed with autism are actually suffering from hidden brain seizures. ||| 调查表明一半嘅儿童 接近一半 被诊断为自闭症嘅 其实系因为有隐藏住个大脑疾病 
 These are the faces of the children that I have tested with stories just like Justin. ||| 呢啲就喺我测试过嘅 小朋友嘅面容 就好似Justin嘅故事咁 
 All these children came to our clinic with a diagnosis of autism, attention deficit disorder, mental retardation, language problems. ||| 呢啲细路 嚟到我哋诊所之前被诊断为 自闭症,注意力缺陷紊乱 精神障碍,语言障碍 
 Instead, our EEG scans revealed very specific problems hidden within their brains that couldn't possibly have been detected by their behavioral assessments. ||| 事实上,我哋嘅EEG脑电图扫描揭示佐 隐藏在大脑入边嘅特殊问题 呢啲问题本来喺无办法 用行为评估检测出嘅 
 So these EEG scans enabled us to provide these children with a much more accurate neurological diagnosis and much more targeted treatment. ||| 所以EEG脑电图扫描 令到我哋可以向依啲小朋友提供一个 精确好多嘅神经生理学诊断 同埋更加之有针对性嘅治疗比呢啲小朋友 
 For too long now, children with developmental disorders have suffered from misdiagnosis while their real problems have gone undetected and left to worsen. ||| 好耐以嚟,有发展紊乱嘅小朋友 忍受住误诊 而真正嘅问题仲未被检测出嚟 而令到佢病情恶化 
 And for too long, these children and their parents have suffered undue frustration and desperation. ||| 一路以嚟,呢啲小朋友同佢哋嘅父母 忍受住過度嘅伤心同绝望 
 But we are now in a new era of neuroscience, one in which we can finally look directly at brain function in real time with no risks and no side effects, non-invasively, and find the true source of so many disabilities in children. ||| 但喺我哋依家处于神经生理学嘅新时代 喺度我哋终于可以直接睇到 大脑嘅实时运行 而无风险同埋副作用,亦无侵略性 我哋可以搵到 令儿童们失常嘅真正原因 
 So if I could inspire even a fraction of you in the audience today to share this pioneering diagnostic approach with even one parent whose child is suffering from a developmental disorder, then perhaps one more puzzle in one more brain will be solved. ||| 所以如果今日我可以启发 就算只系你哋其中嘅一小部分人♪ 将呢种先进嘅诊断手法 分享比就算一个 患有大脑发展紊乱嘅儿童嘅父母 咁可能又一个 脑疾会被治愈 
 One more mind will be unlocked. ||| 又一个紧闭嘅大脑会被打开 
 And one more child who has been misdiagnosed or even undiagnosed by the system will finally realize his or her true potential while there's still time for his or her brain to recover. ||| 咁又一个被误诊 或者系用现在嘅系统无法诊断嘅儿童 终于可以发现佢嘅潜力 因为依家仲有时间 佢嘅大脑仲可以恢复翻 
 And all this by simply watching the child's brainwaves. ||| 而呢啲,只要简单嘅通过睇下佢嘅脑电波就可以做到 
 Thank you. ||| 多谢 
 (Applause) ||| (掌声) 
 And we know why kids drop out. ||| 我哋知道點解有啲學生輟學 
 We know why kids don't learn. ||| 我哋知道點解有啲學生學唔到嘢 
 Everyone in this room has been affected by a teacher or an adult. ||| 在座嘅每一位 總會受過一位老師或者大人影響 
 I have looked at the best and I've looked at some of the worst. ||| 我見過最好嘅教學，亦都見識過最差嘅 
 Needless to say, it was. ||| 唔使我多講，佢嗰年嘅確好艱難 
 I deserve the education that I get here. ||| 我值得喺度接受教育， 
 ""+2" said, "I ain't all bad."" ||| 但係「+2」會令人感覺唔係最差 
 Can we stand to have more relationships? ||| 咁師生之間嘅關係 可唔可以強化？絕對可以 
 Never. ||| 所以唔會，你唔會個個都鐘意 
 It's the connection. It's the relationships. ||| 就係你哋之間嘅聯繫、關係 
 We teach anyway, because that's what we do. ||| 我哋繼續教，因為哩件係我哋該做嘅事 
 Teaching and learning should bring joy. ||| 教學應該係開心嘅事 
 Thank you so much. ||| 多謝 
 (Applause) ||| （掌聲） 
 There's more to this painting than meets the eye. ||| 呢幅畫其實唔只表面咁簡單 
 And yes, it's an acrylic painting of a man, but I didn't paint it on canvas. ||| 雖然，呢幅係畫一個男人嘅亞加力畫 但係我冇畫喺畫布上 
 I painted it directly on top of the man. ||| 我直接畫喺嗰個男人身上 
 What I do in my art is I skip the canvas altogether, and if I want to paint your portrait, I'm painting it on you, physically on you. ||| 我唔用畫布 如果我想畫你嘅肖像 我會直接畫喺你身上 
 It was about shadows. ||| 最初諗法只係同影有關 
 I was fascinated with the absence of light, and I wanted to find a way that I could give it materiality and pin it down before it changed. ||| 我覺得冇光線呢樣嘢好吸引 我想搵一種方法可以令影實物化 喺影改變之前將佢定型 
 I came up with the idea of painting shadows. ||| 於我就想畫低啲影 
 I wanted to think about what else I could put shadows on, and I thought of my friend Bernie. ||| 我想睇下仲有咩地方我可以畫影嘅 然後我諗起我朋友 Bernie 
 But I didn't just want to paint the shadows. ||| 但我唔只想畫影，我仲想做到加強 
 But something kept on flickering before my eyes. ||| 但有啲嘢一直喺我眼前閃 
 I wasn't quite sure what I was looking at. ||| 我當時唔係好清楚我睇到嘅係咩嘢 
 It was about space and light. ||| 畫畫應該係關於空間同光線 
 It just would erase my brush strokes like invisible ink. ||| 因為果酸只會抹走筆觸嘅顏料 就好似隱形墨水一樣 
 I'd put something down, and instantly it would be gone. ||| 當我畫一筆，顏料就咁唔見咗 
 I was having so much fun with this process. ||| 成個過程中我有好多樂趣 
 We got a pool. We filled it with milk. ||| 我哋搵嚟咗一個水池 
 Sometimes, when Sheila would lay down in the milk, it would wash all the paint off of her arms, and it might seem a little bit clumsy, but our solution would be, okay, hide your arms. ||| 有時 Sheila 成個人浸入牛奶 牛奶會沖走佢手臂嘅顏料 令到睇起嚟有啲笨拙 我哋嘅解決方法係，將佢嘅手臂都遮住 
 And one time, she got so much milk in her hair that it just smeared all the paint off of her face. ||| 仲有一次，佢嘅頭髮吸咗好多牛奶 令面上面嘅顏料通通都溶咗 
 All right, well, hide your face. ||| 所以我嗰陣話︰ 「好，咁嘅話，將你塊臉遮著。」 
 Thank you. ||| 多謝各位 
 (Applause) ||| （掌聲） 
 "Two weeks ago I was in my studio in Paris, and the phone rang and I heard, ""Hey, JR, you won the TED Prize 2011." ||| "兩個星期之前，我響巴黎工作室 聽到電話響，話 ""喂 JR... ...你贏左TED2011大獎..." 
 "You have to make a wish to save the world."" I was lost." ||| "...要許個願拯救地球喔。"" 我即時呆左" 
 I mean, I can't save the world. Nobody can. ||| 我唔識拯救世界呀，呢件事無人做得到 
 The world is fucked up. ||| 宜家個世界真系亂到阿媽都唔認得。 
 Come on, you have dictators ruling the world, population is growing by millions, there's no more fish in the sea, the North Pole is melting and as the last TED Prize winner said, we're all becoming fat. ||| 你睇，呢個跟本就系獨裁者嘅天下 人口成百萬咁遞增 海裏面嘅魚無曬 北極啲冰都融埋 先頭嘅TED獲獎得主仲話 我地會越來越肥添。 
 (Laughter) Except maybe French people. ||| （笑） 法國人會唔會例外呢。 
 Whatever. ||| 是但啦。 
 "So I called back and I told her, ""Look, Amy, tell the TED guys I just won't show up." ||| 跟住我打返電話俾佢 同佢講 “嗱，Amy， 你話俾TED班人知，我唔出現啦 
 "I can't do anything to save the world."" She said, ""Hey, JR, your wish is not to save the world, but to change the world."" "Oh, all right."" ||| "我救唔到地球呀。“ 佢就話，”JR呀， 你嘅願望又唔系拯救世界，系改變佢姐。"" "哦，咁啊"" 
 "(Laughter) "That's cool."" ||| （笑） ”甘好啦。“ 
 I mean, technology, politics, business do change the world — not always in a good way, but they do. ||| 其實我發現科技、政治、商業 都響度改變世界— 結果唔一定理想，但系一定有改變。 
 What about art? ||| 咁藝術呢？ 
 Could art change the world? ||| 藝術系咪都可以改變世界？ 
 I started when I was 15 years old. ||| 我從15歲開始搞創作 
 And at that time, I was not thinking about changing the world. ||| 當時無唸住要改變世界 
 I was doing graffiti — writing my name everywhere, using the city as a canvas. ||| 就系玩開graffiti街頭噴畫— 到處留名 將城市當成畫布 
 I was going in the tunnels of Paris, on the rooftops with my friends. ||| 我會鑽入巴黎的隧道 又同朋友爬上樓頂 
 Each trip was an excursion, was an adventure. ||| 每次出去都好盡興 好刺激 
 "It was like leaving our mark on society, to say, ""I was here,"" on the top of a building." ||| 感覺終於響呢個社會留底屬於我地自己嘅印記 響樓頂記低“本人到此一遊” 
 So when I found a cheap camera on the subway, I started documenting those adventures with my friends and gave them back as photocopies — really small photos just that size. ||| 有一次我響地鐵執到部簡易相機 之後就開始拍低我同朋友嘅歷險記 然後將相片畀返佢地 啲相好細張，得咁大 
 That's how, at 17 years old, I started pasting them. ||| 然之後，17歲嘅我就咁 開始左我嘅貼相生涯 
 "And I did my first ""expo de rue,"" which means sidewalk gallery." ||| "搞左自己的第一個expo de rue 無非系一個""街頭影展”" 
 And I framed it with color so you would not confuse it with advertising. ||| 我響每一張相片周圍涂左彩色框 路人就唔會以為系廣告 
 I mean, the city's the best gallery I could imagine. ||| 我發現城市真系一個最佳畫廊 
 I would never have to make a book and then present it to a gallery and let them decide if my work was nice enough to show it to people. ||| 無必要出書 更加無必要搵畫廊 請專家鑒定 作品系咪夠好 夠吸引 
 I would control it directly with the public in the streets. ||| 響大街度 可以更加直接 
 So that's Paris. ||| 呢張系巴黎 
 I would change — depending on the places I would go — the title of the exhibition. ||| 我會視乎 展出地點 調整主題。 
 That's on the Champs-Elysees. ||| 呢張系香榭麗舍大街 
 I was quite proud of that one. ||| 呢張系我嘅得意之作 
 Because I was just 18 and I was just up there on the top of the Champs-Elysees. ||| 因為嗰年我先18歲 就已經佔領香榭麗舍嘅頂峰。 
 Then when the photo left, the frame was still there. ||| 後來張相唔見左 相框仲留響度 
 (Laughter) November 2005: the streets are burning. ||| （笑） 2005年11月： 火燒街頭 
 A large wave of riots had broken into the first projects of Paris. ||| 大規模暴亂 響巴黎最舊的住宅區爆發 
 Everyone was glued to the TV, watching disturbing, frightening images taken from the edge of the neighborhood. ||| 人人睇電視追蹤 見到從住宅區周邊傳返來嘅影像 畫面令人擔憂又驚恐 
 I mean, these kids, without control, throwing Molotov cocktails, attacking the cops and the firemen, looting everything they could in the shops. ||| 呢啲細路無人管教 起勢掟汽油炸彈 攻擊警察同消防隊 掃蕩商舖 
 These were criminals, thugs, dangerous, destroying their own environment. ||| 呢班罪犯、歹徒同危險分子 用盡手段同環境抗爭 
 And then I saw it — could it be possible? — my photo on a wall revealed by a burning car — a pasting I'd done a year earlier — an illegal one — still there. ||| 忽然間我見到一樣嘢—有無可能啊？— 畫面嘅牆上有一幅我貼嘅相 就響嗰部燒著嘅汽車後面— 我一年前貼嘅— 呢張非法張貼—仲響度 
 I mean, these were the faces of my friends. ||| 相片裏面系我朋友嘅面孔 
 I know those guys. ||| 我瞭解呢啲人 
 All of them are not angels, but they're not monsters either. ||| 佢哋都唔系天使 但亦唔系惡魔 
 So it was kind of weird to see those images and those eyes stare back at me through a television. ||| 響電視度睇見啲眼望住自己 感覺有些少怪 
 So I went back there with a 28 mm lens. ||| 於是我返返去 帶埋部28mm焦距相機 
 It was the only one I had at that time. ||| 亦系我當時唯一一部相機 
 But with that lens, you have to be as close as 10 inches from the person. ||| 用佢影相 要靠埋個人物 離得25公分 
 So you can do it only with their trust. ||| 所以攝影師一定要俾人信得過至影到相 
 So I took full portraits of people from Le Bosquet. ||| 我影左四張相，主角都系Le Bosquet波士基人 
 They were making scary faces to play the caricature of themselves. ||| 佢地扮怪面嚇人 用搞笑誇張嘅方式表現自我 
 And then I pasted huge posters everywhere in the bourgeois area of Paris with the name, age, even building number of these guys. ||| 跟住我將啲相整成巨幅海報 貼勻巴黎嘅bourgeois購物區 上面寫埋人物嘅姓名，年齡 連屋企嘅門牌號都有埋 
 A year later, the exhibition was displayed in front of the city hall of Paris. ||| 一年之後 呢輯相片響巴黎市政廳前展出 
 And we go from thug images, who've been stolen and distorted by the media, who's now proudly taking over his own image. ||| 對比起以前我地睇到嗰啲 經過媒體偷拍、扭曲嘅相 嗰日展出嘅一張張自豪嘅面龐 
 That's where I realized the power of paper and glue. ||| 響一刻令我意識到 紙張同漿糊嘅力量 
 So could art change the world? ||| 藝術系咪都可以改變世界呢？ 
 A year later, I was listening to all the noise about the Middle East conflict. ||| 時隔一年 我聽講中東地區衝突連連 傳黎各種聲音 
 I mean, at that time, trust me, they were only referring to the Israeli and Palestinian conflict. ||| 當時，我可以負責任咁講 所有話題都指向以色列同巴勒斯坦 
 So with my friend Marco, we decided to go there and see who are the real Palestinians and who are the real Israelis. ||| 所以我同朋友Marco 決定去現場 見識一下真正的巴勒斯坦人同真正的以色列人 
 Are they so different? ||| 佢地之間差別真系咁大咩？ 
 When we got there, we just went in the street, started talking with people everywhere, and we realized that things were a bit different from the rhetoric we heard in the media. ||| 落腳之後我地出街 周圍同人傾計 發現事實同媒體嘅聲音 有些少差別 
 So we decided to take portraits of Palestinians and Israelis doing the same jobs — taxi-driver, lawyer, cooks. ||| 於是我地又決定影頭像 主角系從事同樣職業嘅 巴勒斯坦人同以色列人 — 有的士司機、律師、同埋有廚師 — 
 Asked them to make a face as a sign of commitment. ||| 為表誠意 我地請佢地扮鬼 
 Not a smile — that really doesn't tell about who you are and what you feel. ||| 唔系笑— 因為笑面無辦法傳達人嘅心理狀態同感受 
 They all accepted to be pasted next to the other. ||| 佢地都接受 將自己嘅相同對方嘅貼埋一齊 
 I decided to paste in eight Israeli and Palestinian cities and on both sides of the wall. ||| 我決定去8個以色列 同巴勒斯坦城市貼相 貼系牆嘅兩邊 
 We launched the biggest illegal art exhibition ever. ||| 我哋籌辦左有史以來最大型的非法藝術展 
 We called the project Face 2 Face. ||| 個名稱系：面對面 
 "The experts said, ""No way." ||| 專家話 ”無可能[做到]... 
 The people will not accept. ||| "民眾唔會接受...""" 
 "The army will shoot you, and Hamas will kidnap you."" We said, ""Okay, let's try and push as far as we can."" I love the way that people will ask me, "How big will my photo be?"" ||| """...軍隊會開槍打你，同埋哈馬斯會綁架你哋。“ 我哋就話 ”咁 我地試下可以行幾遠啦“ 我最鍾意人哋問我 “到時我張相有幾大架？”" 
 ""It will be as big as your house."" ||| ”會同你間屋一樣咁大呀“ 
 When we did the wall, we did the Palestinian side. ||| 貼相上牆嘅時候，我地響巴勒斯坦 
 So we arrived with just our ladders and we realized that they were not high enough. ||| 帶埋條梯到現場， 先發現條梯唔夠高。 
 "And so Palestinians guys say, "Calm down. No wait. I'm going to find you a solution."" ||| 於是幾個巴勒斯坦人話， “唔好心急，等陣。我幫你搞掂佢” 
 So he went to the Church of Nativity and brought back an old ladder that was so old that it could have seen Jesus being born. ||| 佢跑到一個基督教堂 扛左一條舊梯返黎 條梯真系舊到不得了，我估可能系耶穌時期傳落黎嘅 
 (Laughter) We did Face 2 Face with only six friends, two ladders, two brushes, a rented car, a camera and 20,000 square feet of paper. ||| （笑） 系6個朋友嘅幫助之下，我哋完成左”面對面“ 兩條梯，兩把刷 一架租返黎嘅車，一部相機 仲有20000平方英寸嘅纸 
 We had all sorts of help from all walks of life. ||| 我哋得到各行各業嘅人 各式各樣嘅幫助。 
 Okay, for example, that's Palestine. ||| 就好似呢張巴勒斯坦相甘， 
 We're in Ramallah right now. ||| 我哋當時系拉馬拉 
 We're pasting portraits — so both portraits in the streets in a crowded market. ||| 貼緊相 — 兩張相都貼系熱鬧嘅市場 
 "People come around us and start asking, "What are you doing here?"" ||| 啲人圍住我哋，問我哋 ”你哋系到做緊咩呀？“ 
 """Oh, we're actually doing an art project and we are pasting an Israeli and a Palestinian doing the same job." ||| “哦，我哋搞緊藝術呀 我哋宜家將做同一個工作嘅以色列人同巴勒斯坦人嘅相貼埋一齊。 
 "And those ones are actually two taxi-drivers."" And then there was always a silence." ||| 呢兩個就系的士司機喇。” 呢個時候啲人就會驚左。 
 """You mean you're pasting an Israeli face — doing a face — right here?"" "Well, yeah, yeah, that's part of the project."" ||| "“你嘅意思系你系度 — 貼緊以色列人嘅相？"" “哦，系呀，系呀，系呢個藝術嘅一部分黎架。”" 
 "And I would always leave that moment, and we would ask them, "So can you tell me who is who?"" ||| 呢個時候，我會俾佢地睇一陣， 然後問佢地， “你可唔可以話我聽邊個打邊個呀？” 
 And most of them couldn't say. ||| 而佢地大部分都講唔出。 
 (Applause) We even pasted on Israeli military towers, and nothing happened. ||| （鼓掌） 我哋甚至系以色列嘅軍事防禦塔到貼左相， 咩都無發生。 
 When you paste an image, it's just paper and glue. ||| 當你貼一張相嘅時候，佢只不過系紙同漿糊。 
 People can tear it, tag on it, or even pee on it — some are a bit high for that, I agree — but the people in the street, they are the curator. ||| 啲人可以搣左佢，貼野系上面，甚至可以系上面尿尿 不過有啲太高啦，我諗應該尿唔到 — 但系街上面嘅人， 佢哋就系策展人。 
 The rain and the wind will take them off anyway. ||| 遇到落雨打風，啲相遲早會唔見 
 They are not meant to stay. ||| 我本來就無打算要佢哋留系到。 
 But exactly four years after, the photos, most of them are still there. ||| 不過正正4年之後， 果啲相大多數仲系到。 
 Face 2 Face demonstrated that what we thought impossible was possible — and, you know what, even easy. ||| ”面對面“證實左 有啲我哋覺得唔可能嘅事系可能發生嘅 — 而且，你知唔知呀？好易架咋。 
 We didn't push the limit; we just showed that they were further than anyone thought. ||| 我哋無挑戰界限， 我哋只不過系證明我哋做到嘅野比啲人諗嘅遠。 
 In the Middle East, I experienced my work in places without [many] museums. ||| 系中東，我系[好多]博物館 展出我嘅作品。 
 So the reactions in the street were kind of interesting. ||| 系街展覽呢個方向 有啲搞笑。 
 So I decided to go further in this direction and go in places where there were zero museums. ||| 於是我決定繼續向呢個方向發展 去啲無博物館嘅地方。 
 When you go in these developing societies, women are the pillars of their community, but the men are still the ones holding the streets. ||| 當你行入呢啲發展中嘅社會， 你會發現女人系佢地社區嘅支柱， 不過男人仲系條街嘅話事人。 
 So we were inspired to create a project where men will pay tribute to women by posting their photos. ||| 於是我哋啟發左要創作一個項目 等啲男人通過啲相 向女人致敬。 
 I called that project Women Are Heroes. ||| 我叫呢個項目做《婦女系英雄》 
 When I listened to all the stories everywhere I went on the continents, I couldn't always understand the complicated circumstances of their conflict. ||| 當我聽到果啲故事嘅時候 系任何我去過嘅地方， 我唔系次次都明 衝突嘅複雜情況， 
 I just observed. ||| 我淨系觀察。 
 Sometimes there was no words, no sentence, just tears. ||| 有時候系無文字， 無句子，只有眼淚。 
 I just took their pictures and pasted them. ||| 我影左佢地嘅相 貼左出黎。 
 Women Are Heroes took me around the world. ||| 《婦女系英雄》帶我走遍世界。 
 Most of the places I went to, I decided to go there because I've heard about it through the media. ||| 我去左好多地方。 我決定去果度 系因為我系媒體上面聽過。 
 So for example, in June 2008, I was watching TV in Paris, and then I heard about this terrible thing that happened in Rio de Janeiro — the first favela of Brazil named Providencia. ||| 好似2008年6月 我系巴黎睇電視， 聽到系 里約熱內盧發生嘅慘案。 巴西嘅第一個貧民窟叫做Providencia 
 Three kids — that was three students — were [detained] by the army because they were not carrying their papers. ||| 三個細路，系三個學生黎嘅， 被軍隊扣押 因為佢地無帶身份證明 
 And the army took them, and instead of bringing them to the police station, they brought them to an enemy favela where they get chopped into pieces. ||| 軍隊抓住佢地 無將佢地送去警局， 反而將佢地送左去一個同佢地有仇嘅貧民窟 於是佢地俾人斬到一碌碌。 
 I was shocked. ||| 我好震驚。 
 All Brazil was shocked. ||| 所有巴西人都好震驚。 
 I heard it was one of the most violent favelas, because the largest drug cartel controls it. ||| 我聽講呢個系最暴力嘅貧民窟之一 因為最大嘅販毒集團掌控呢個區域。 
 So I decided to go there. ||| 所以我決定去果度。 
 When I arrived — I mean, I didn't have any contact with any NGO. ||| 當我抵達嘅時候 — 我嘅意思系，我無同任何NGO取得聯繫。 
 There was none in place — no association, no NGOs, nothing — no eyewitnesses. ||| 果度咩都無 — 無旅行社，無NGO，咩都無 — 連證人都無。 
 So we just walked around, and we met a woman, and I showed her my book. ||| 我哋周圍行， 然後遇到一個女人， 我俾我本書佢睇。 
 "And she said, ""You know what?" ||| 然後佢同我講，”你知唔知呀？ 
 We're hungry for culture. ||| 我哋好文化飢渴呀。 
 "We need culture out there."" So I went out and I started with the kids." ||| 我哋呢度需要文化。” 我從幫小朋友影相開始。 
 I just took a few photos of the kids, and the next day I came with the posters and we pasted them. ||| 我淨系拍左幾張小朋友嘅相， 第二日我攞住張海報過黎，貼上去。 
 The day after, I came back and they were already scratched. ||| 第三日已經俾人搣左喇。 
 But that's okay. ||| 不過，唔緊要啦。 
 I wanted them to feel that this art belongs to them. ||| 我就系想俾佢地覺得啲藝術系佢地嘅。 
 Then the next day, I held a meeting on the main square and some women came. ||| 第四日，我系主要嘅廣場開左個會 有哋婦女黎左。 
 They were all linked to the three kids that got killed. ||| 佢地都系同果三個比人殺死嘅細路有關。 
 There was the mother, the grandmother, the best friend — they all wanted to shout the story. ||| 有細路嘅阿媽，阿婆，好朋友。 佢地全部都想大叫甘講個故事出黎。 
 After that day, everyone in the favela gave me the green light. ||| 果日之後， 每個貧民窟嘅人都對我開左綠燈。 
 I took more photos, and we started the project. ||| 我影左更多相，終於開始左個計劃。 
 "The drug lords were kind of worried about us filming in the place, so I told them, ""You know what?" ||| 啲毒販對於我哋系到影相 有啲擔心。 我同佢哋講，“你哋知唔知呀？ 
 I'm not interested in filming the violence and the weapons. ||| 我對暴力同武器無興趣。 
 You see that enough in the media. ||| 你系媒體度都見到啦。 
 What I want to show is the incredible life and energy. ||| 我要展示呢到嘅美好生活。 
 "I've been seeing it around me the last few days."" So that's a really symbolic pasting, because that's the first one we did that you couldn't see from the city." ||| "而過去幾日我真系見到。"" 呢張好有代表性， 因為呢個系第一張你系城市見唔到嘅相。" 
 And that's where the three kids got arrested, and that's the grandmother of one of them. ||| 三個細路就系o系呢到俾人抓左， 張相入面就系其中一個人嘅阿婆。 
 And on that stairs, that's where the traffickers always stand and there's a lot of exchange of fire. ||| 而呢條樓梯， 就系啲毒販成日黎嘅地方。 呢度成日都交火。 
 Everyone there understood the project. ||| 個個都明白個計劃系咩意思。 
 And then we pasted everywhere — the whole hill. ||| 然後我哋將啲相貼滿左成個山。 
 (Applause) What was interesting is that the media couldn't get in. ||| （掌聲） 有趣嘅系媒體過唔到黎。 
 I mean, you should see that. ||| 我嘅意思系，你可以理解。 
 They would have to film us from a really long distance by helicopter and then have a really long lens, and we would see ourselves, on TV, pasting. ||| 佢地系從好遠嘅距離嘅直升機上面影我哋， 要用果種好長嘅鏡頭， 然後我哋可以系電視機見到自己貼緊相。 
 "And they would put a number: ""Please call this number if you know what's going on in Providencia."" We just did a project and then left so the media wouldn't know." ||| "而且佢地仲寫左個電話，話：“如果你知道 果度發生左咩事，請打呢個電話。"" 我哋做完個計劃就走左 所以媒體唔知道發生咩事。" 
 So how can we know about the project? ||| 甘點樣可以了解呢個計劃呢？ 
 So they had to go and find the women and get an explanation from them. ||| 所以佢地去左搵啲女人 從佢地果到得到解釋。 
 So you create a bridge between the media and the anonymous women. ||| 甘樣，你就創造左一個媒體 同埋無名氏婦女之間嘅橋樑。 
 We kept traveling. ||| 我哋繼續旅行。 
 We went to Africa, Sudan, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Kenya. ||| 一路去左非洲、蘇丹、塞拉热昂、 利比里亞、肯尼亞。 
 In war-torn places like Monrovia, people come straight to you. ||| 系好似蒙羅維亞啲戰火紛飛嘅地方， 啲人會直接走到你面前。 
 I mean, they want to know what you're up to. ||| 姐系，佢哋想知道你黎呢到做咩。 
 "They kept asking me, ""What is the purpose of your project?" ||| 佢地不停問我，”你黎呢到有咩目的？ 
 "Are you an NGO? Are you the media?"" Art. Just doing art." ||| "你系咪NGO嘅人呀？你系咪媒體呀？"" 藝術，搞藝術咋。" 
 "Some people question, ""Why is it in black and white?" ||| "有啲人問，""點解系黑白架？" 
 "Don't you have color in France?"" (Laughter) Or they tell you, ""Are these people all dead?"" Some who understood the project would explain it to others." ||| "法國無顏色咩？” （笑） 有時佢地會問，""呢啲人系咪死左呀？"" 有哋人睇得明，就會同其他人解釋。" 
 "And to a man who did not understand, I heard someone say, ""You know, you've been here for a few hours trying to understand, discussing with your fellows." ||| 我聽到有個人同個唔明嘅人解釋， “嗱，你企系到幾個鐘 冥思苦想，同你嘅同伴討論。 
 During that time, you haven't thought about what you're going to eat tomorrow. ||| 系呢段時間，你從來都無諗過 聽日食啲咩。 
 "This is art."" I think it's people's curiosity that motivates them to come into the projects." ||| "甘就系藝術啦。"" 我覺得系啲人嘅好奇心 激發佢地 去參與呢個計劃。" 
 And then it becomes more. ||| 所以個計劃先會越來越多。 
 It becomes a desire, a need, an armor. ||| 變成一種慾望，一種需要，一種[聽唔清楚]。 
 On this bridge that's in Monrovia, ex-rebel soldiers helped us pasting a portrait of a woman that might have been raped during the war. ||| 系蒙羅維亞嘅橋上面， 一個曾經系叛軍嘅軍人幫我哋貼一張相 呢張相系一個系戰爭中被軍隊強姦嘅婦女。 
 Women are always the first ones targeted during conflict. ||| 系衝突之中 婦女總系最早嘅受害者。 
 This is Kibera, Kenya, one of the largest slums of Africa. ||| 呢到系这是肯尼亞的基貝拉， 非洲最大嘅貧民窟之一。 
 You might have seen images about the post-election violence that happened there in 2008. ||| 你或者見過2008選舉後發生 嘅一啲畫面。 
 This time we covered the roofs of the houses, but we didn't use paper, because paper doesn't prevent the rain from leaking inside the house — vinyl does. ||| 今次我哋從房頂落手， 不過我哋無用紙， 因為紙一落雨就無左 唔可以幫啲屋擋雨 — 乙烯基塑料就得喇。 
 Then art becomes useful. ||| 呢個時候藝術有實際用途。 
 So the people kept it. ||| 啲人保留左佢地。 
 You know what I love is, for example, when you see the biggest eye there, there are so [many] houses inside. ||| 我最鍾意嘅系當你睇到最大果隻眼嘅時候， 你可以看到眼睛果到有好多屋。 
 And I went there a few months ago — photos are still there — and it was missing a piece of the eye. ||| 幾個月前我去左果度 — 啲相仲系到 — 不過眼睛入面有一塊唔見左。 
 So I asked the people what happened. ||| 我問啲人發生咩事。 
 ""Oh, that guy just moved."" ||| “哦，果個人搬左屋呀。” 
 "(Laughter) When the roofs were covered, a woman said as a joke, "Now God can see me."" ||| （笑） 當我哋將啲乙烯基塑料鋪系屋頂嘅時候，有個女人同我哋講笑， ”宜家上帝可以見到我啦。“ 
 When you look at Kibera now, they look back. ||| 你宜家再睇基貝拉， 佢地都會睇返你 
 Okay, India. ||| 好啦，印度。 
 Before I start that, just so you know, each time we go to a place, we don't have authorization, so we set up like commandos — we're a group of friends who arrive there, and we try to paste on the walls. ||| 我開始講之前，你要知道， 我們每一次去一個地方，都無旅遊顧問， 所以我哋搞到好似突擊隊甘 — 我哋一班人去到果個地方， 到左就想辦法講啲相貼到牆上面。 
 But there are places where you just can't paste on a wall. ||| 不過有啲地方你唔可以就甘貼野系牆。 
 In India it was just impossible to paste. ||| 系印度想貼野系無可能嘅。 
 I heard culturally and because of the law, they would just arrest us at the first pasting. ||| 我聽講系文化同埋法律嘅原因， 如果我們系牆貼左野，就會即刻俾人拉。 
 So we decided to paste white, white on the walls. ||| 於是我哋決定貼白色， 系牆上貼白紙。 
 So imagine white guys pasting white papers. ||| 你想像下一班人系牆到貼白紙。 
 "So people would come to us and ask us, "Hey, what are you up to?"" ||| 有人過黎問我哋， “喂，你哋搞緊咩呀？” 
 ""Oh, you know, we're just doing art." "Art?"" ||| “哦，無野，搞緊藝術。” “藝術？” 
 Of course, they were confused. ||| 當然，佢地好唔知點甘嘅樣。 
 But you know how India has a lot of dust in the streets, and the more dust you would have going up in the air, on the white paper you can almost see, but there is this sticky part like when you reverse a sticker. ||| 不過你知啦，印度條街好多塵架嘛， 越多塵 系空氣到飄下飄下， 系白紙到都見到甘制， 不過有啲位系有粘性嘅 就好似你反轉張貼紙甘。 
 So the more dust you have, the more it will reveal the photo. ||| 所以越多塵，就越可以見到張相。 
 So we could just walk in the street during the next days and the photos would get revealed by themselves. ||| 之後幾日我哋系條街到行 就見到啲相自己顯現左出黎。 
 (Applause) Thank you. ||| （掌聲） 多謝。 
 So we didn't get caught this time. ||| 所以我哋今次無俾人抓住。 
 Each project — that's a film from Women Are Heroes. ||| 呢個計劃，系《婦女系英雄》 一條片。 
 (Music) Okay. ||| （音樂） （好） 
 For each project we do a film. ||| 我哋將每一個計劃 都整左一條片。 
 "And most of what you see — that's a trailer from ""Women Are Heroes"" — its images, photography, taken one after the other." ||| 呢個系《婦女系英雄》嘅預告片 — 有形象、相片， 一張一張排起。 
 And the photos kept traveling even without us. ||| 就是我哋唔系到，啲相都會繼續旅行。 
 (Laughter) (Applause) Hopefully, you'll see the film, and you'll understand the scope of the project and what the people felt when they saw those photos. ||| （笑） （掌聲） 希望你哋有機會睇到呢條片， 然後你就會明白呢個計劃嘅範圍 同埋啲人見到啲相有咩感覺。 
 Because that's a big part of it. There's layers behind each photo. ||| 呢個系計劃更重要嘅一部分。每一張相都有層次。 
 Behind each image is a story. ||| 每張相都有故事。 
 Women Are Heroes created a new dynamic in each of the communities, and the women kept that dynamic after we left. ||| 《婦女系英雄》呢個計劃為社區 增加左新嘅活力， 呢啲婦女系我哋走左之後仲繼續保持呢種活力。 
 For example, we did books — not for sale — that all the community would get. ||| 例如，我哋整左啲書 — 非賣品 — 全個社區都可以得到。 
 But to get it, they would have to [get] it signed by one of the women. ||| 不過想要就要攞本書俾其中一個女人簽名。 
 We did that in most of the places. ||| 好多地方我哋都甘做。 
 We go back regularly. ||| 我哋定時定候就會返去。 
 And so in Providencia, for example, in the favela, we have a cultural center running there. ||| 包括果個貧民窟， 我哋系果到有一個固定嘅中心。 
 In Kibera, each year we cover more roofs. ||| 系基貝拉，每年我哋都會整多啲相系房頂。 
 "Because of course, when we left, the people who were just at the edge of the project said, ""Hey, what about my roof?"" So we decided to come the year after and keep doing the project." ||| 因為，每一次我哋走果陣，有啲人嘅房頂就系我哋個計劃旁邊， 佢地話：“喂，我個屋頂呢？” 於是我哋決定第二年再去過 繼續做呢個計劃。 
 A really important point for me is that I don't use any brand or corporate sponsors. ||| 對我黎講，好重要嘅一點系 我無用任何品牌或者公司嘅贊助。 
 So I have no responsibility to anyone but myself and the subjects. ||| 所以我對其他人無責任 除左對自己 仲有呢個主題。 
 (Applause) And that is for me one of the more important things in the work. ||| （掌聲） 對我黎講 亦系我工作中最重要嘅事 
 I think, today, as important as the result is the way you do things. ||| 我覺得，宜家， 事情嘅結果同你做事嘅方式一樣重要。 
 And that has always been a central part of the work. ||| 而呢個總系工作嘅一部分。 
 And what's interesting is that fine line that I have with images and advertising. ||| 有趣嘅系我會將圖像同廣告 明確甘分開。 
 We just did some pasting in Los Angeles on another project in the last weeks. ||| 上個禮拜，我哋系洛杉磯 貼左啲相，開始左一個新計劃。 
 And I was even invited to cover the MOCA museum. ||| 佢地甚至邀請我將啲相貼到加州現代藝術博物館。 
 "But yesterday the city called them and said, ""Look, you're going to have to tear it down." ||| 不過尋日，市政府嘅人打電話俾我 ，話 “睇黎，我哋要將佢地搣左佢。 
 "Because this can be taken for advertising, and because of the law, it has to be taken down."" But tell me, advertising for what?" ||| 因為啲人會覺得我哋做緊廣告， 法律唔俾呀， 以一定要攞落黎。“ 不過唔該話我知，我哋做緊咩廣告？ 
 The people I photograph were proud to participate in the project and to have their photo in the community. ||| 俾我影相嘅人 好自豪甘黎參加呢個計劃 好自豪可以系社區展示佢地嘅相。 
 But they asked me for a promise basically. ||| 佢地只有一個好基本嘅要求。 
 "They asked me, ""Please, make our story travel with you."" So I did. That's Paris." ||| "佢地話，”求下你啦，俾我哋嘅故事同你一齊旅行。"" 所以我做左。呢到系巴黎。" 
 That's Rio. ||| 呢到系里約。 
 In each place, we built exhibitions with a story, and the story traveled. ||| 每一個地方，我哋都用一個故事做展覽，然後呢個故事開始傳播。 
 You understand the full scope of the project. ||| 你會理解成個計劃嘅範圍。 
 That's London. ||| 呢到系倫敦， 
 New York. ||| 紐約。 
 And today, they are with you in Long Beach. ||| 今日，佢地系長島，同你一齊。 
 All right, recently I started a public art project where I don't use my artwork anymore. ||| 好啦，最近我開始左另外一項公共藝術項目 今次我唔用自己嘅作品喇。 
 I use Man Ray, Helen Levitt, Giacomelli, other people's artwork. ||| 我用Man Ray, Helen Levitt Gracomelli，其他人嘅作品。 
 It doesn't matter today if it's your photo or not. ||| 系唔系你嘅相唔緊要。 
 The importance is what you do with the images, the statement it makes where it's pasted. ||| 重要嘅系你用啲相 黎做咩， 佢貼嘅地方有咩用意。 
 So for example, I pasted the photo of the minaret in Switzerland a few weeks after they voted the law forbidding minarets in the country. ||| 舉例，我貼左一張尖塔嘅相 系瑞士， 因為佢地系幾個禮拜之前投票通過禁止國內起尖塔嘅法律。 
 (Applause) This image of three men wearing gas masks was taken in Chernobyl originally, and I pasted it in Southern Italy, where the mafia sometimes bury the garbage under the ground. ||| （掌聲） 呢張有三個帶住防毒面具男人嘅相， 系o系Chernobyl影嘅， 我將佢貼系意大利南部， 果度啲黑手黨成日將啲垃圾埋系地下。 
 In some ways, art can change the world. ||| 從某啲方面黎講，藝術系可以改變世界嘅。 
 Art is not supposed to change the world, to change practical things, but to change perceptions. ||| 藝術本身唔系為左改變世界， 唔系為左去改變具體的事， 而系去改變觀點。 
 Art can change the way we see the world. ||| 藝術可以改變 我哋睇世界嘅方式。 
 Art can create an analogy. ||| 藝術可以創造一種類比。 
 Actually the fact that art cannot change things makes it a neutral place for exchanges and discussions, and then enables you to change the world. ||| 事實上藝術改變唔到事態 藝術處於中立地帶 為交流同討論提供環境， 令到改變世界變得可能。 
 When I do my work, I have two kinds of reactions. ||| 系我創作嘅時候， 一般會遇到兩種反應。 
 "People say, ""Oh, why don't you go in Iraq or Afghanistan." ||| 有人會話：”噢，你不如去伊拉克或者阿富汗啦... 
 "They would be really useful."" Or, ""How can we help?"" I presume that you belong to the second category, and that's good, because for that project, I'm going to ask you to take the photos and paste them." ||| 響嗰邊一定好有用。“ 又有人問 ”我哋可以點幫你？“ 我諗你哋似乎系屬於第二類， 其實系好事 因為呢個計劃， 我要請大家影相 然後貼出黎。 
 So now my wish is: (mock drum roll) (Laughter) I wish for you to stand up for what you care about by participating in a global art project, and together we'll turn the world inside out. ||| 所以我宜家嘅心願系： (敲鼓動作) （笑） 我希望各位積極參與 通過呢個全球性的藝術項目 表現你最關切的人物事件， 我哋一齊顛覆世界。 
 And this starts right now. ||| 而家就開始 
 Yes, everyone in the room. ||| 從在座的每一位開始 就系你 
 Everyone watching. ||| 仲有屏幕另一邊嘅每一位觀眾 
 I wanted that wish to actually start now. ||| 我希望呢個願望 可以從呢一分鐘開始實行。 
 So a subject you're passionate about, a person who you want to tell their story or even your own photos — tell me what you stand for. ||| 揀一個你心動嘅主題 搵一位有精彩故事嘅人物 或者你自己張相 — 話我知 你嘅觀點。 
 Take the photos, the portraits, upload it — I'll give you all the details — and I'll send you back your poster. Join by groups and reveal things to the world. ||| 影啲相，影啲人像， 放上網—我會講明細節— 跟住等我寄返張海報俾你。一班人一齊 將現實展示俾全世界。

 What we see changes who we are. ||| 我哋見到嘅野會改變我哋。 
 When we act together, the whole thing is much more than the sum of the parts. ||| 當我哋一齊行動， 團體嘅效應遠遠超出個人嘅總和 
 So I hope that, together, we'll create something that the world will remember. ||| 所以我希望，我哋可以一齊創造 一啲世界會記得嘅事。 
 And this starts right now and depends on you. ||| 宜家開始啦，靠曬你。 
 Thank you. ||| 多謝。 
 (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) ||| (掌聲) 多謝大家 （掌聲） 
 I had just gone through a breakup. ||| 嗰時我啱啱分咗手 
 Could we jump-start that memory back to life, maybe even play with the contents of that memory? ||| 我哋可唔可以將記憶帶返嚟現實生活 甚至操作記憶？ 
 First, you find and label a memory in the brain, and then you activate it with a switch. ||| 首先，你要搵同埋標記 大腦裏邊嘅一個記憶 然後用開關激活個記憶 
 As simple as that. ||| 就係咁簡單 
 (Laughter) SR: Are you convinced? ||| （笑聲） 史︰你哋信未？ 
 So, turns out finding a memory in the brain isn't all that easy. ||| 實際上喺大腦裏面搵一個記憶 並唔係咁容易 
 But luckily, we got help from the brain itself. ||| 但係幸運嘅係 我哋由大腦自身獲得幫助 
 It shouldn't take minutes or hours to work. ||| 佢唔可以花幾分鐘或者幾個鐘去做到 
 It should act at the speed of the brain, in milliseconds. ||| 佢應該以大腦嘅速度去做 
 SR: So what do you think, Xu? ||| 史︰劉，咁你點睇？ 
 XL: Nah. Drugs are pretty messy. They spread everywhere. ||| 劉︰唔得。因為藥物會擴散，好麻煩 
 And also it takes them forever to act on cells. ||| 而且藥物作用係永遠嘅 
 So it will not allow us to control a memory in real time. ||| 所以我哋唔能夠用藥物即時控制記憶 
 So Steve, how about let's zap the brain with electricity? ||| 咁史蒂夫，用電控制大腦你覺得點？ 
 SR: All right, and here's the million-dollar experiment. ||| 史︰呢個係價值百萬美元嘅實驗 
 They want to know, what's going on in this new box? ||| 佢哋想知道，呢個新嘅籠有乜嘢 
 It's interesting. ||| 老鼠好得意 
 But the moment we turned on the laser, like you see now, all of a sudden the mouse entered this freezing mode. ||| 但當我哋啟動激光嘅一刻 老鼠即刻進入靜止狀態 
 It stayed here and tried not to move any part of its body. ||| 老鼠呆咗，唔郁 
 Clearly it's freezing. ||| 好明顯，老鼠定咗型 
 (Laughter) So after the experiment, the two of us just left the room without saying anything. ||| （笑聲） 實驗完咗之後，我哋離開間房 冇講過嘢 
 Could we possibly even turn it into a false memory? ||| 我哋會唔會將個記憶 變成一個錯誤嘅記憶？ 
 Yes we can. ||| 係，我哋可以做到 
 It's sort of like making a remix tape. ||| 就好似整混合錄音咁 
 SR: So how do we do this? ||| 史︰咁我哋點樣做呢？ 
 So everything we've been talking about today is based on this philosophically charged principle of neuroscience that the mind, with its seemingly mysterious properties, is actually made of physical stuff that we can tinker with. ||| 我哋今日所講嘅嘢 都係基於神經科學一條哲學性嘅原理 就係，思想睇起嚟好神秘 但佢實際上係由物質組成 兼可以俾我哋利用嘅嘢 
 Nowadays people are sitting 9.3 hours a day, which is more than we're sleeping, at 7.7 hours. ||| 今日，人平均每天坐 9.3 個鐘 呢個比我哋嘅瞓覺時間 7.7 個鐘，仲要多 
 Sitting is so incredibly prevalent, we don't even question how much we're doing it, and because everyone else is doing it, it doesn't even occur to us that it's not okay. ||| 「坐」係難以置信嘅普遍 因為所有人都做緊同樣嘅嘢 而且平時我哋冇諗過我哋坐咗幾耐 我哋甚至冇發覺呢樣嘢係唔好 
 In that way, sitting has become the smoking of our generation. ||| 可以話，我哋呢一代坐嘅問題 等如上一代人吸煙嘅問題 
 Of course there's health consequences to this, scary ones, besides the waist. ||| 坐當然仲有不良嘅健康後果 當中嚇人嘅，除咗腰部問題之外 
 Now, any of those stats should convince each of us to get off our duff more, but if you're anything like me, it won't. ||| 到呢一刻，呢啲統計應該都說服到我哋 唔好由朝坐到晚 但如果你好似我咁 仍然都係無動於衷嘅話 
 What did get me moving was a social interaction. ||| 咁社交就係令你同我活動嘅原因 
 It's changed my life. ||| 咁樣嘅開會方式改變咗我 
 So now, several hundred of these walking meetings later, I've learned a few things. ||| 但係宜家，經過幾百次行路開會之後 我學到一啲嘢 
 Whether it's nature or the exercise itself, it certainly works. ||| 就算係同大自然或者運動有關嘅事也好 
 Walk the talk. ||| 畀行路帶領談話 
 Thank you. ||| 多謝大家 
 Gamma is just one of these companies. ||| Gamma 只係其中一間咁樣嘅公司 
 This is the managing director of Gamma International. ||| 呢位係 Gamma International 嘅董事總經理 
 His name is Martin Muench. ||| Martin Muench 
 There are many photos of Mr. Muench that exist. ||| 佢出現過喺好多相裏邊 
 This is perhaps my favorite. ||| 呢張係我最鍾意嘅 
 You can see there's a little sticker that's placed over his camera. ||| 可以見到有一張細黐紙 黐咗喺攝錄機度 
 "[""While your target is browsing the web, exchanging documents, receiving SMS, crossing the borders""] You have to hit many different platforms." ||| [「當你監控對象喺度上網、 交換文件、收短訊、過境」] 你必須要攻入好多唔同嘅平台 
 So, Hacking Team has also been actively courting the U.S. law enforcement market. ||| 所以 美國司法管轄地方嘅市場 
 The company has also hired a spokesperson. ||| 仲請咗一名發言人 
 They've spoken at the conferences. ||| 佢哋有喺研討會度發言 
 My friends at an organization called the Electronic Frontier Foundation — they're a civil society group — obtained hundreds of documents from the FBI detailing their next generation of surveillance technologies. ||| 我有個朋友喺電子領域基金會度做 呢個基金會一個民間組織 佢哋攞咗好多 FBI 嘅文件 裏邊寫低 FBI 下一代嘅監聽科技會係點 
 Now, when I first looked into this, I'd never heard of this unit before. ||| 當我第一次見到呢樣嘢 我從來未聽過呢個單位 
 I've been studying surveillance for more than six years. ||| 我已經研究咗監控呢樣嘢超過六年啦 
 I'd never heard of it. ||| 但我由未聽過呢個單位 
 This is South Los Angeles. (Laughter) Liquor stores, fast food, vacant lots. ||| 所以呢度係南洛杉磯（笑聲） 好多酒舖 好多快餐 好多空地 
 Just like 26.5 million other Americans, I live in a food desert, South Central Los Angeles, home of the drive-thru and the drive-by. ||| 同其他 2,650 萬美國人一樣 我住喺一個食物荒蕪之地 就係洛杉磯中南部 亦係外賣車道普遍 同馬路槍擊頻繁嘅地方 
 Funny thing is, the drive-thrus are killing more people than the drive-bys. ||| 有趣嘅係 
 I got tired of seeing this happening. ||| 我對呢種情況好厭倦 
 And I figured, this has to stop. ||| 我就諗：呢啲嘢要停喇 
 So I figured that the problem is the solution. ||| 我後來發現問題嘅癥結係解決嘅關鍵 
 Food is the problem and food is the solution. ||| 敗也食物，成也食物 
 Plus I got tired of driving 45 minutes round trip to get an apple that wasn't impregnated with pesticides. ||| 再加上，我唔想再來回 45 分鐘車程 先至買到冇農藥嘅蘋果 
 So what I did, I planted a food forest in front of my house. ||| 於是，我就喺屋企門前整咗一塊田 
 It was on a strip of land that we call a parkway. ||| 位置就係嗰條又長又窄嘅馬路邊草地 
 It's 150 feet by 10 feet. ||| 大概係 150 呎長、十呎闊 
 Thing is, it's owned by the city. ||| 問題係，它係屬於市政府嘅 
 But you have to maintain it. ||| 但係必須由你自己去打理 
 And the garden, it was beautiful. ||| 果園好靚 
 And then somebody complained. ||| 但跟住就有人去投訴 
 "And I'm like, ""Come on, really?" ||| 我當時嘅反應係：「唔係啩？ 
 I mean, come on, why wouldn't they? ||| 我覺得：梗係啦 點解佢哋會唔鐘意吖 
 They own 26 square miles of vacant lots. ||| 有成 26 平方里嘅空地 
 That's 20 Central Parks. ||| 相當於 20 個中央公園 
 That's enough space to plant 725 million tomato plants. ||| 呢個空間足夠種 7.25 億棵番茄樹 
 Why in the hell would they not okay this? ||| 佢哋有乜鬼理由會唔鐘意？ 
 Growing one plant will give you 1,000, 10,000 seeds. ||| 一棵植物可以提供一千、一萬粒種子 
 Growing your own food is like printing your own money. ||| 自己種嘢食就好似自己印銀紙咁 
 I grew up there. I raised my sons there. ||| 我喺嗰邊大，我啲仔又係喺嗰邊大 
 And I refuse to be a part of this manufactured reality that was manufactured for me by some other people, and I'm manufacturing my own reality. ||| 但係依家呢個現實社會 係人為製造出嚟嘅 所以我好拒絕呢個現實社會 我要製造我自己嘅現實生活 
 See, I'm an artist. ||| 而且，我係一名藝術家 
 Gardening is my graffiti. I grow my art. ||| 花草樹木有如我嘅塗鴉 
 So what happened? ||| 咁，究竟發生咗咩事呢？ 
 I have witnessed my garden become a tool for the education, a tool for the transformation of my neighborhood. ||| 我見證住自己嘅花圃 變成有教育意義嘅事 同埋改造到我個社區 
 To change the community, you have to change the composition of the soil. ||| 但我想講，要改變社區 
 We are the soil. ||| 而我哋就係泥土 
 So I'm like, man, it made me feel bad that they were there, and I told them, you know, you don't have to do this like this. ||| 但見到咁，我覺得好難受 我就同佢哋講話︰ 「其實你哋唔使咁樣， 
 If kids grow kale, kids eat kale. ||| 如果啲細路種甘藍菜 咁佢哋就食甘藍菜 
 And when we do this, who knows? ||| 我哋咁樣做嘅時候 
 Now this is one of my plans. This is what I want to do. ||| 依家，呢個就係我其中一個計劃 
 I want to plant a whole block of gardens where people can share in the food in the same block. ||| 我想種一大片田 畀啲街坊可以分享食物 
 The funny thing about sustainability, you have to sustain it. ||| 經營係一件好得意嘅嘢 就係你必須經營落去 
 So what I want to do here, we gotta make this sexy. ||| 我而家喺度想做嘅係 首先我哋必須要令 農圃耕作搞到好有噱頭 
 If you ain't a gardener, you ain't gangsta. ||| 如果你唔係園丁，咁你就唔係幫派份子 
 And let that be your weapon of choice. ||| 等個鏟成為你嘅武器 
 Peace. Thank you. ||| 係咁多，多謝 
 I went to this village for the first time. ||| 第一次去到個農村 
 """What are you doing here?" ||| 「咁你過嚟做咩？點解要嚟呢度？ 
 You have to have a dignity of labor. ||| 唔會因為勞動而羞恥 
 So we started the Barefoot College, and we redefined professionalism. ||| 所以我哋開始咗赤腳學院 我哋將「專業」重新定義 
 There are no contracts, no written contracts. ||| 冇有合同，從來都唔需要簽合同 
 And no one can get more than $100 a month. ||| 無人可以一個月賺取多過一百美金 
 You come for the money, you don't come to Barefoot College. ||| 如果你想賺錢，你就嚟錯咗地方嘞 
 That is where we want you to try crazy ideas. ||| 呢度我哋想你測試瘋狂嘅想法 
 Battered, bruised, you start again. ||| 最多咪重頭嚟過 
 And it's the only college where we don't give a certificate. ||| 同時亦係唯一一間唔頒證書嘅學院 
 You are certified by the community you serve. ||| 你嘅學歷係由你服務嘅社區嚟鑑定 
 Since 1986, it hasn't leaked. ||| 1986 年到宜家都無漏過水 
 This technology, the women will not share with the men. ||| 呢門技術，婦女唔會同男士分享㗎嘞 
 All the power comes from the sun. ||| 所有電力嚟自太陽 
 45 kilowatts of panels on the roof. ||| 四萬五千瓦嘅太陽能板裝喺屋頂 
 Food, if you come to the Barefoot College, is solar cooked. ||| 如果你嚟到赤腳學院 所有食物都係靠太陽能煮熟 
 Very little water is wasted. ||| 所以咁多年嚟我哋浪費咗好少水 
 This is what we teach in the night schools. ||| 呢啲都係我哋夜校教嘅知識 
 Wasn't dazzled at all by what was happening. ||| 但佢對當時嘅場面都一啲唔驚訝 
 (Laughter) Went to Afghanistan. ||| （笑聲） 嚟到阿富汗… 
 One lesson we learned in India was men are untrainable. ||| 我哋喺印度學識嘅一件事︰ 男人係教唔識嘅 
 They go back and solar-electrify their own village. ||| 佢哋返去自己條村度 裝設太陽能發電設施 
 And they haven't collapsed. ||| 而且無一間冧過 
 I knew which woman I would like to take. ||| 我好知道要揀邊個女性 
 Don't listen to the World Bank, listen to the people on the ground. ||| 唔好聽世界銀行講 
 The question today is not: Why did we invade Afghanistan? ||| 今日嘅問題唔係︰ 點解我哋派兵阿富汗？ 
 The question is: why are we still in Afghanistan one decade later? ||| 問題係︰ 點解十年後嘅今日 我哋仲喺阿富汗？ 
 Why are we spending $135 billion? ||| 點解我哋要用 1350億美金？ 
 Why have we got 130,000 troops on the ground? ||| 點解仲有13萬地面軍隊？ 
 How has this happened? ||| 點解會咁？ 
 The last 20 years has been the age of intervention, and Afghanistan is simply one act in a five-act tragedy. ||| 過去20年 係干預嘅年代 阿富汗只係五幕悲劇中嘅 其中一幕 
 We came out of the end of the Cold War in despair. ||| 我哋喺絕望中 由冷戰結束行出嚟 
 We faced Rwanda; we faced Bosnia, and then we rediscovered our confidence. ||| 我哋面對盧旺達 我哋面對波斯尼亞 然後我哋搵番自信 
 In the third act, we went into Bosnia and Kosovo and we seemed to succeed. ||| 喺第三幕，我哋進入波斯尼亞同科索沃 而且我哋睇起嚟成功咗 
 In the fourth act, with our hubris, our overconfidence developing, we invaded Iraq and Afghanistan, and in the fifth act, we plunged into a humiliating mess. ||| 喺第四幕 傲慢助長咗過度自信 我哋入侵咗伊拉克同阿富汗 而喺第五章 我哋趺入咗令人羞愧嘅混亂 
 So the question is: What are we doing? ||| 所以個問題係︰我哋喺度做緊咩？ 
 Why are we still stuck in Afghanistan? ||| 點解我哋仲留喺阿富汗？ 
 And the answer, of course, that we keep being given is as follows: we're told that we went into Afghanistan because of 9/11, and that we remain there because the Taliban poses an existential threat to global security. ||| 答案，當然 正如人哋一直同我哋咁講︰ - 我哋派兵阿富汗 係因為911 而軍隊仲留喺當地 係因為塔利班對全球嘅安全 存在威脅 
 "In the words of President Obama, ""If the Taliban take over again, they will invite back Al-Qaeda, who will try to kill as many of our people as they possibly can."" The story that we're told is that there was a ""light footprint"" initially — in other words, that we ended up in a situation where we didn't have enough troops, we didn't have enough resources, that Afghans were frustrated — they felt there wasn't enough progress and economic development and security, and therefore the Taliban came back — that we responded in 2005 and 2006 with troop deployments, but we still didn't put enough troops on the ground." ||| "用總統奧巴馬嘅說話︰ ""如果塔利班再次掌控 佢哋會請阿爾蓋達組織番嚟 殺盡我哋嘅人"" - 人哋講咗呢個故事俾我哋聽 一開始只係一個""輕足印"" – 即係話，當時嘅情況 無足夠嘅軍隊 無足夠嘅資源 令阿富汗人失望 佢哋覺得經濟發展同保安 嘅進展都都唔夠 所以塔利班番咗嚟 – 於是我哋喺2005同2006年 進行咗軍隊部署 但係我哋嘅地面部隊都係唔夠" 
 "And that it wasn't until 2009, when President Obama signed off on a surge, that we finally had, in the words of Secretary Clinton, "the strategy, the leadership and the resources."" ||| "直至2009年 總統奧巴馬簽署咗增加兵嘅方案 終於，我哋有啦 用美國國務卿希拉里嘅說話 "戰略、領導同資源"" 
 So, as the president now reassures us, we are on track to achieve our goals. ||| 所以總統依架同我哋保證 我哋向緊目標進發 
 All of this is wrong. ||| 所有都係錯架 
 Every one of those statements is wrong. ||| 每一句都係錯架 
 Afghanistan does not pose an existential threat to global security. ||| 阿富汗無對全球全球嘅安全 造成威脅 - 
 It is extremely unlikely the Taliban would ever be able to take over the country — extremely unlikely they'd be able to seize Kabul. ||| 而塔利班 係其乎無可能奪得國家嘅控制權 – 佢哋無咩可能奪取喀布爾 
 They simply don't have a conventional military option. ||| 佢哋根本無常規軍隊 
 And even if they were able to do so, even if I'm wrong, it's extremely unlikely the Taliban would invite back Al-Qaeda. ||| 就算佢哋可以咁做，就算我錯 塔利班都無咩可能 請阿爾蓋達組織番嚟 
 From the Taliban's point of view, that was their number one mistake last time. ||| 喺塔利班嘅角度嚟睇 呢個正係佢哋上次犯嘅最大錯誤 
 If they hadn't invited back Al-Qaeda, they would still be in power today. ||| 如果佢哋無請阿爾蓋達組織番嚟 佢哋今日仲掌緊權 
 And even if I'm wrong about those two things, even if they were able to take back the country, even if they were to invite back Al-Qaeda, it's extremely unlikely that Al-Qaeda would significantly enhance its ability to harm the United States or harm Europe. ||| 如果呢兩點我都係錯 就算佢哋可以攞番個國家 就算佢哋請阿爾蓋達組織番嚟 阿爾蓋達組織都唔太可能 大幅增加實力 去危害美國 去危害歐洲 
 Because this isn't the 1990s anymore. ||| 因為依架已經唔再係90年代 
 If the Al-Qaeda base was to be established near Ghazni, we would hit them very hard, and it would be very, very difficult for the Taliban to protect them. ||| 如果阿爾蓋達組織嘅基地 係喺加茲尼附近 我哋就可以大力打擊佢哋 而塔利班就好難，好難 保護佢哋 
 Furthermore, it's simply not true that what went wrong in Afghanistan is the light footprint. ||| 再講，人哋話 阿富汗嘅問題係輕足印 係錯架 
 In my experience, in fact, the light footprint was extremely helpful. ||| 喺我嘅經驗嚟睇，事實上 輕足印係非常有幫助 
 And these troops that we brought in — it's a great picture of David Beckham there on the sub-machine gun — made the situation worse, not better. ||| 我哋呢啲軍隊 – 將碧咸張靚相 放咗喺佢哋嘅衝鋒槍上 – 令到情況差咗，而唔係好咗 
 When I walked across Afghanistan in the winter of 2001-2002, what I saw was scenes like this. ||| 喺2001到2002年嘅冬天 我徒步橫越阿富汗 我睇到嘅係咁樣嘅景象 
 A girl, if you're lucky, in the corner of a dark room — lucky to be able to look at the Koran. ||| 一個女仔，如果你好彩嘅話 喺一間陰暗嘅房間角落 – 好好彩咁可以睇可蘭經 
 But in those early days when we're told we didn't have enough troops and enough resources, we made a lot of progress in Afghanistan. ||| 但係之前 當我哋嘅軍隊同資源都唔夠嘅時候 我哋喺阿富汗嘅進展好好 
 Within a few months, there were two and a half million more girls in school. ||| 喺幾個月之內 多咗25萬個女仔入學 
 In Sangin where I was sick in 2002, the nearest health clinic was within three days walk. ||| 2002年我喺Sangin嘅時候病咗 最近嘅診所 要行三日先到 
 Today, there are 14 health clinics in that area alone. ||| 今日，單單喺嗰個地區 就有14間診所 
 There was amazing improvements. ||| 進展得好驚人 
 We went from almost no Afghans having mobile telephones during the Taliban to a situation where, almost overnight, three million Afghans had mobile telephones. ||| 阿富汗人由塔利班 幾乎無人有手提電話嘅時代 到差唔多一夜間 30萬阿富汗人都有手提電話 
 And we had progress in the free media. ||| 我哋喺媒體自由方面都有進展 
 We had progress in elections — all of this with the so-called light footprint. ||| 選舉方面都有進展 – 呢啲就係所謂嘅輕足印 
 But when we began to bring more money, when we began to invest more resources, things got worse, not better. How? ||| 但係當我哋開始投放更多資金 當我哋投入更多資源 事情變壞，而無好到，點解？ 
 Well first see, if you put 125 billion dollars a year into a country like Afghanistan where the entire revenue of the Afghan state is one billion dollars a year, you drown everything. ||| 首先，如果你每年將1250億美金 投放喺阿富汗呢種國家 全國整體收入 每年只有10億美金 你就會掩蓋曬所有嘢 
 It's not simply corruption and waste that you create; you essentially replace the priorities of the Afghan government, the elected Afghan government, with the micromanaging tendencies of foreigners on short tours with their own priorities. ||| 你唔只造成貪污 同浪費 你根本上取代咗阿富汗政府嘅主要任務 選出嚟嘅阿富汗政府 傾向微觀管理 去短途旅行嘅外國人 - 
 And the same is true for the troops. ||| 軍隊方面都係一樣道理 
 When I walked across Afghanistan, I stayed with people like this. ||| 我行過阿富汗嘅時候 我同呢啲人一齊 
 This is Commandant Haji Malem Mohsin Khan of Kamenj. ||| 佢係喺 Kamenj 嘅指揮官 Haji Malem Mohsin Khan 
 Commandant Haji Malem Mohsin Khan of Kamenj was a great host. ||| 佢係一個好好嘅主人 
 He was very generous, like many of the Afghans I stayed with. ||| 佢好慷慨 同好多我相處過嘅阿富汗人一樣 
 But he was also considerably more conservative, considerably more anti-foreign, considerably more Islamist than we'd like to acknowledge. ||| 但係佢比我哋認為嘅 相對地更保守 相對更排斥外國 相對更相信伊斯蘭教 
 This man, for example, Mullah Mustafa, tried to shoot me. ||| 好似呢個人 Mullah Mustafa 試過身射殺我 
 And the reason I'm looking a little bit perplexed in this photograph is I was somewhat frightened, and I was too afraid on this occasion to ask him, having run for an hour through the desert and taken refuge in this house, why he had turned up and wanted to have his photograph taken with me. ||| 我喺呢張相入面望落有嘅困惑嘅原因 係我有啲嚇親 當時我好驚，唔敢問佢 佢用咗成個鐘跑過嗰沙漠 匿喺呢間屋 問佢點解會出現要我同佢合照 
 But 18 months later, I asked him why he had tried to shoot me. ||| 但18個月之後，我問佢 點解要射殺我 
 And Mullah Mustafa — he's the man with the pen and paper — explained that the man sitting immediately to the left as you look at the photograph, Nadir Shah had bet him that he couldn't hit me. ||| Mullah Mustafa 解釋 因為我係拎住紙同筆嘅人 喺呢張相我嘅左手邊 Nadir Shah同佢輸賭佢打唔到我 
 Now this is not to say Afghanistan is a place full of people like Mullah Mustafa. ||| 我嘅意思唔係話 阿富汗人都同 Mullah Mustafa 
 It's not; it's a wonderful place full of incredible energy and intelligence. ||| 唔係咁嘅，嗰個地方好美好 充滿活力同智慧 
 But it is a place where the putting-in of the troops has increased the violence rather than decreased it. ||| 但係呢個地方 被投放咗軍隊 增加咗，而無減少到暴力 
 2005, Anthony Fitzherbert, an agricultural engineer, could travel through Helmand, could stay in Nad Ali, Sangin and Ghoresh, which are now the names of villages where fighting is taking place. ||| 2005年，Anthony Fitzherbert 係一位農業工程師 可以橫越赫爾曼德省 可以留喺 Nad Ali， Sangin 同 Ghoresh 呢啲哋方依架已經成為咗戰地 
 Today, he could never do that. ||| 今日，佢唔再可以咁樣做 
 So the idea that we deployed the troops to respond to the Taliban insurgency is mistaken. ||| 所以我哋話以部處軍隊 嚟回應塔利班嘅叛亂 係錯架 
 Rather than preceding the insurgency, the Taliban followed the troop deployment, and as far as I'm concerned, the troop deployment caused their return. ||| 部署軍隊唔係喺塔利班叛亂之後發生 而係隨之而嚟 依我睇 部署軍隊係塔利班回歸嘅原因 
 Now is this a new idea? ||| 呢個係一個新嘅講法？ 
 No, there have been any number of people saying this over the last seven years. ||| 唔係，喺過去嘅七年 已經有好多人談論呢個觀點 
 I ran a center at Harvard from 2008 to 2010, and there were people like Michael Semple there who speak Afghan languages fluently, who've traveled to almost every district in the country. ||| 喺 2008 至 2010 年我喺哈佛 管理過一個中心 嗰度嘅人，好似 Michael Semple 可以講流利嘅阿富汗語言 佢幾乎遊歷過阿富汗所有地區 
 Andrew Wilder, for example, born on the Pakistan-Iranian border, served his whole life in Pakistan and Afghanistan. ||| 例如 Andrew Wilder 喺巴基斯坦同伊朗邊境出世 佢一生嘅工作 都喺巴基斯坦同阿富汗 
 Paul Fishstein who began working there in 1978 — worked for Save the Children, ran the Afghan research and evaluation unit. ||| Paul Fishstein 喺 1978 年開始喺阿富汗工作 – 喺救助兒童會做 負責當地嘅研究同評估小組 
 These are people who were able to say consistently that the increase in development aid was making Afghanistan less secure, not more secure — that the counter-insurgency strategy was not working and would not work. ||| 呢啲人 佢哋由始至終都係話 增加發展援助 令阿富汗無咁安全，而唔係更安全 – 而反叛亂策略 係行唔通，亦唔會行得通 
 And yet, nobody listened to them. ||| 但係，無人聽佢哋講 
 Instead, there was a litany of astonishing optimism. ||| 反而 係一連串令人驚訝嘅樂團主義 
 "Beginning in 2004, every general came in saying, ""I've inherited a dismal situation, but finally I have the right resources and the correct strategy, which will deliver,"" in General Barno's word in 2004, the ""decisive year."" Well guess what? It didn't." ||| "喺 2004 年開始 每一位上任嘅將軍都話 ""我接手咗一個慘淡嘅局面 但最終我有適合嘅資源同啱嘅策略 會創造"" 用 Barno 將軍喺 2004 年嘅原話 係“決定性嘅一年” 你估下點？事實唔係咁" 
 "But it wasn't sufficient to prevent General Abuzaid saying that he had the strategy and the resources to deliver, in 2005, the ""decisive year."" Or General David Richards to come in 2006 and say he had the strategy and the resources to deliver the ""crunch year."" Or in 2007, the Norwegian deputy foreign minister, Espen Eide, to say that that would deliver the ""decisive year."" Or in 2008, Major General Champoux to come in and say he would deliver the ""decisive year."" Or in 2009, my great friend, General Stanley McChrystal, who said that he was ""knee-deep in the decisive year.""" ||| "但係咁並唔足以去阻止 Abuzaid 將軍話 佢有戰略同資源 喺 2005 年創造 "決定性嘅一年" 或者 David Richards 將軍喺 2006 年上任嘅時候 佢話有戰略同資源 創造""關鍵嘅一年"" 或者喺 2007 年 挪威副外交大臣 Espen Eide 話會創造""決定性嘅一年"" 或者喺2008年 Champoux 少將 上任仲适佢會創造""決定性嘅一年"" 或者喺2009年，我嘅好朋友 Stanley McChrystal 將軍 話佢""非常關注決定性嘅一年""" 
 "Or in 2010, the U.K. foreign secretary, David Miliband, who said that at last we would deliver the ""decisive year."" And you'll be delighted to hear in 2011, today, that Guido Westerwelle, the German foreign minister, assures us that we are in the ""decisive year."" (Applause) How do we allow any of this to happen?" ||| "或者喺2010年 英國外相文禮彬 話至少我哋會創造""決定性嘅一年"" 2001年的今天，你一定会高兴地听到， 德國外交部長 Guido Westerwelle 同我哋保證我哋處於""決定性嘅一年"" (掌聲) 我哋點會俾 呢啲嘢發生？" 
 Well the answer, of course, is, if you spend 125 billion or 130 billion dollars a year in a country, you co-opt almost everybody. ||| 個答案當然係 如果你在一个国家每年 花 1250 亿或 1300亿美元， 你得和几乎所有人合作， 
 Even the aid agencies, who begin to receive an enormous amount of money from the U.S. and the European governments to build schools and clinics, are somewhat disinclined to challenge the idea that Afghanistan is an existential threat to global security. ||| 甚至连援助机构 由于他们从美国和欧洲政府 那里收到巨资 建设学校和诊所 他们也开始不愿意 挑战和面对现存的说法 说阿富汗对全球安全 存在极大威胁。 
 They're worried, in other words, that if anybody believes that it wasn't such a threat — Oxfam, Save the Children wouldn't get the money to build their hospitals and schools. ||| 换句话说，他们担心， 如果人们相信那里没有那么大的威胁， 像乐施会和拯救儿童这样的慈善机构 将失去这些资金 也就建不成他们的医院和学校。 
 It's also very difficult to confront a general with medals on his chest. ||| 另外你很难在一位胸前挂满勋章 的将军面前提出异议。 
 It's very difficult for a politician, because you're afraid that many lives have been lost in vain. ||| 对政客来说这很难， 你怕或许这么多人白白浪费了生命。 
 You feel deep, deep guilt. ||| 你深深感到愧疚。 
 You exaggerate your fears, and you're terrified about the humiliation of defeat. ||| 你夸大你的恐惧 然后你被竞选失败的屈辱前景 吓倒了。 
 What is the solution to this? ||| 如何解决这局面？ 
 Well the solution to this is we need to find a way that people like Michael Semple, or those other people, who are telling the truth, who know the country, who've spent 30 years on the ground — and most importantly of all, the missing component of this — Afghans themselves, who understand what is going on. ||| 解决的办法是 我们需要 像 Michael Semple 他们这样的人， 了解国家的情况，讲述当地的实情， 在当地有30年的经验—— 更重要的是， 这之中缺失的成分—— 阿富汗的人们， 他们明白发生在自己国家的事。 
 We need to somehow get their message to the policymakers. ||| 我们需要找到一条渠道，把他们的声音 传递给决策者。 
 And this is very difficult to do because of our structures. ||| 由于我们的体制 这点很难做到。 
 The first thing we need to change is the structures of our government. ||| 首先我们需要改变的 是我们政府的结构。 
 Very, very sadly, our foreign services, the United Nations, the military in these countries have very little idea of what's going on. ||| 非常悲哀的是， 我们的使馆，联合国 驻扎在这些国家的军队 不了解当地情况。 
 The average British soldier is on a tour of only six months; Italian soldiers, on tours of four months; the American military, on tours of 12 months. ||| 英国军人驻扎的平均任期只有六个月； 意大利军人，驻扎任期四个月； 美国军队，驻扎任期十二个月。 
 Diplomats are locked in embassy compounds. ||| 驻地的外交人员不让出使馆。 
 When they go out, they travel in these curious armored vehicles with these somewhat threatening security teams who ready 24 hours in advance who say you can only stay on the ground for an hour. ||| 即使出行，也是在戒备森严的车辆中 并有吓人的保镖陪伴 你还要提前24小时预定这些保镖 他们只准许你在外边停留一个小时。 
 In the British embassy in Afghanistan in 2008, an embassy of 350 people, there were only three people who could speak Dari, the main language of Afghanistan, at a decent level. ||| 在阿富汗的英国使馆 2008年， 整个使馆的350名工作人员， 只有三个人会把阿富汗的主要语言 波斯语，说到流利的程度。 
 And there was not a single Pashto speaker. ||| 没有一个人会讲普什图语的。（阿富汗另一主要语言——译者注） 
 In the Afghan section in London responsible for governing Afghan policy on the ground, I was told last year that there was not a single staff member of the foreign office in that section who had ever served on a posting in Afghanistan. ||| 在伦敦的阿富汗部 负责制定阿富汗当地政策的部门， 去年我被告知 在那个部门的对外办公室 没有一个成员 曾经在 阿富汗任过职。 
 So we need to change that institutional culture. ||| 所以我们需要改变这种体制文化。 
 And I could make the same points about the United States and the United Nations. ||| 我可以指出美国有同样的问题 还有联合国也是。 
 Secondly, we need to aim off of the optimism of the generals. ||| 第二，我们需要小心对待将军们的乐观。 
 We need to make sure that we're a little bit suspicious, that we understand that optimism is in the DNA of the military, that we don't respond to it with quite as much alacrity. ||| 我们需要一些怀疑态度， 建立在我们对军队的了解 乐观态度是融在军队的基因中的， 我们对这点 不够敏感。 
 And thirdly, we need to have some humility. ||| 第三点，我们应该有谦逊的态度。 
 We need to begin from the position that our knowledge, our power, our legitimacy is limited. ||| 我们需要对自己有一个正确的定位 我们的知识，我们的权力， 我们的合法性 都时有限的。 
 This doesn't mean that intervention around the world is a disaster. ||| 这并不是说 在世界上的干预都是无益的。 
 It isn't. ||| 不是的。 
 Bosnia and Kosovo were signal successes, great successes. ||| 波斯尼亚和科索沃 都是成功的实例， 了不起的成功。 
 Today when you go to Bosnia it is almost impossible to believe that what we saw in the early 1990s happened. ||| 今天你若去波斯尼亚 你是不会相信 90年代我们看到的那些情景，真正发生过。 
 It's almost impossible to believe the progress we've made since 1994. ||| 自从1994年，在我们的帮助下，那里的进展 简直让人无法相信 
 Refugee return, which the United Nations High Commission for Refugees thought would be extremely unlikely, has largely happened. ||| 难民回归家园， 有悖于联合国难民署的预测 认为十分不可能发生的事情， 在那里大规模的发生了。 
 A million properties have been returned. ||| 一百万份地产被退还。 
 Borders between the Bosniak territory and the Bosnian-Serb territory have calmed down. ||| 波什尼亚克 和波斯尼亚塞族之间的边界停止了争端。 
 The national army has shrunk. ||| 国家的军队缩减了。 
 The crime rates in Bosnia today are lower than they are in Sweden. ||| 波斯尼亚今天的犯罪率 比瑞典还要低。 
 This has been done by an incredible, principled effort by the international community, and, of course, above all, by Bosnians themselves. ||| 成就于此 是源于国际社会 了不起的，有原则的努力 当然，最主要的是 波斯尼亚人自己的努力。 
 But you need to look at context. ||| 另外你需要看事发的背景。 
 And this is what we've lost in Afghanistan and Iraq. ||| 这是我们在对待阿富汗和伊拉克中缺失的。 
 You need to understand that in those places what really mattered was, firstly, the role of Tudman and Milosevic in coming to the agreement, and then the fact those men went, that the regional situation improved, that the European Union could offer Bosnia something extraordinary: the chance to be part of a new thing, a new club, a chance to join something bigger. ||| 在那里我们要明白 要素是 首先，图季曼和米洛舍维奇 在达成协议中的角色， 他们的下台， 当地局势的改善， 欧盟能给波斯尼亚 带来的是新的开始； 一个机会 能加入一个新生的俱乐部， 一个加入美好前景的机会。 
 And finally, we need to understand that in Bosnia and Kosovo, a lot of the secret of what we did, a lot of the secret of our success, was our humility — was the tentative nature of our engagement. ||| 然后，我们需要看明白在波斯尼亚和科索沃， 我们成就的秘密， 我们成功的秘密， 是我们的谦逊—— 是我们在干预时小心谨慎。 
 We criticized people a lot in Bosnia for being quite slow to take on war criminals. ||| 我们批评了很多波斯尼亚的人 他们对战犯迟迟采取不了行动。 
 We criticized them for being quite slow to return refugees. ||| 我们批评他们 在接受难民时行动缓慢。 
 But that slowness, that caution, the fact that President Clinton initially said that American troops would only be deployed for a year, turned out to be a strength, and it helped us to put our priorities right. ||| 想起克林顿总统开始时说 美国军队只需驻扎一年， 但正是这缓慢的行动，这谨慎， 现在看来是优势， 这帮助了我们搞清重点。 
 One of the saddest things about our involvement in Afghanistan is that we've got our priorities out of sync. ||| 在我们对阿富汗的干预中 最悲哀的莫过于 所有人的重点不一致。 
 We're not matching our resources to our priorities. ||| 我们的资源配置也不在重点上。 
 Because if what we're interested in is terrorism, Pakistan is far more important than Afghanistan. ||| 你看若我们是在反恐， 巴基斯坦远比阿富汗重要。 
 If what we're interested in is regional stability, Egypt is far more important. ||| 若我们是保卫区域局势稳定， 埃及相比更加重要。 
 If what we're worried about is poverty and development, sub-Saharan Africa is far more important. ||| 若我们是在为贫困和发展而担忧， 撒哈拉以南的非洲应是重点。 
 This doesn't mean that Afghanistan doesn't matter, but that it's one of 40 countries in the world with which we need to engage. ||| 这并不是说阿富汗不重要， 但这只是世界上我们需要 照顾的40个国家之一。 
 So if I can finish with a metaphor for intervention, what we need to think of is something like mountain rescue. ||| 那么如果我可以用一个比喻来形容国际干预， 我们可以把它 想象成山地救援。 
 Why mountain rescue? ||| 为什么用山地救援比喻？ 
 Because when people talk about intervention, they imagine that some scientific theory — the Rand Corporation goes around counting 43 previous insurgencies producing mathematical formula saying you need one trained counter-insurgent for every 20 members of the population. ||| 因为当人们说起国际干预， 他们脑子里出现的是科学理论—— 兰德公司出去 搜集43个叛乱先例的资料 制出一个数学方程式 得出的答案告诉你，每20个居民 需要一个专业反叛部队成员保护。 
 This is the wrong way of looking at it. ||| 这是错误的方法。 
 You need to look at it in the way that you look at mountain rescue. ||| 应该用山地救援的方法看待此任务。 
 When you're doing mountain rescue, you don't take a doctorate in mountain rescue, you look for somebody who knows the terrain. ||| 山地救援中， 你绝不会套用公式来用于山地救援， 你会找个熟悉地形的人。 
 It's about context. ||| 一切因情况而定。 
 You understand that you can prepare, but the amount of preparation you can do is limited — you can take some water, you can have a map, you can have a pack. ||| 你可以提前准备， 但可准备的程度 是有限的。 你可以带点些水，带张地图， 背个包。 
 But what really matters is two kinds of problems — problems that occur on the mountain which you couldn't anticipate, such as, for example, ice on a slope, but which you can get around, and problems which you couldn't anticipate and which you can't get around, like a sudden blizzard or an avalanche or a change in the weather. ||| 但真正起确定性因素的问题 是两种困难—— 在山间出现的 不可预料的困难， 例如，山斜坡上结的冰， 这个还可以避开， 另外就是你无法预料 也没办法避开的困难， 像突发的暴风雪或是雪崩 甚至仅是天气的变化。 
 And the key to this is a guide who has been on that mountain, in every temperature, at every period — a guide who, above all, knows when to turn back, who doesn't press on relentlessly when conditions turn against them. ||| 这里的关键 就是找一个到过此山的向导， 了解在每个温度下 每季每时此山的状况—— 最关键的是，这个向导， 知道该在何时放弃返回， 在骤然恶化的环境下他不会 一而再，再而三地尝试。 
 What we look for in firemen, in climbers, in policemen, and what we should look for in intervention, is intelligent risk takers — not people who plunge blind off a cliff, not people who jump into a burning room, but who weigh their risks, weigh their responsibilities. ||| 我们挑选消防员， 警察和登山者时用的条件， 也适用于国际干预人员的选择， 那就是智能的冒险者—— 不是那些跳入深崖的人， 不是冲进熊熊燃烧的房间的人， 而是会判断风险， 并承担责任的人。 
 Because the worst thing we have done in Afghanistan is this idea that failure is not an option. ||| 因为我们在阿富汗最坏的行动是 给出了一个理念 那就是不准失败。 
 It makes failure invisible, inconceivable and inevitable. ||| 这使得失败变成了透明的， 不可思议的，然后不可避免的。 
 And if we can resist this crazy slogan, we shall discover — in Egypt, in Syria, in Libya, and anywhere else we go in the world — that if we can often do much less than we pretend, we can do much more than we fear. ||| 我们若抵抗住了这 疯狂口号的诱惑， 我们就会发现—— 在埃及，叙利亚，利比亚， 还有我们干预的世界各处—— 若我们能比我们假装出来的，能做到的，要少做一些， 我们将会做到我们担忧中的，做不到的，要多很多。 
 Thank you very much. ||| 十分感谢。 
 (Applause) Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. ||| （鼓掌声） 谢谢。十分感谢。 谢谢。十分感谢。 
 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause) ||| 谢谢。谢谢。谢谢。 （鼓掌声） 
 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. ||| 谢谢。 谢谢。谢谢。 谢谢。 
 (Applause) ||| （鼓掌声） 
 Bruno Giussani: Rory, you mentioned Libya at the end. Just briefly, what's your take on the current events there and the intervention? Rory Stewart: Okay, I think Libya poses the classic problem. The problem in Libya ||| Bruno Giussani: 罗伊，你在最后提到利比亚。 简单的，你对那里现状是什么的看法 还有在那里的干预？ 罗伊：好，我认为利比亚是一个经典的问题。 利比亚的问题是 
 is that we are always pushing for the black or white. ||| 我们总是要非黑既白。 
 We imagine there are only two choices: either full engagement and troop deployment or total isolation. ||| 我们总想象只有两种选择： 或者是完全投入部署部队 或是孤立对方。 
 And we are always being tempted up to our neck. ||| 我们总是忍不住深深的陷进去。 
 We put our toes in and we go up to our neck. ||| 我们刚把脚趾放进去，整个人就陷进去了。 
 What we should have done in Libya is we should have stuck to the U.N. resolution. ||| 我们在利比亚应该 严格遵守联合国决议。 
 We should have limited ourselves very, very strictly to the protection of the civilian population in Benghazi. ||| 我们应该非常严格把自己的参与限制于 保护班加西的平民。 
 We could have done that. ||| 我们本可以做到这点。 
 We set up a no-fly zone within 48 hours because Gaddafi had no planes within 48 hours. ||| 我们在48小时内制定了禁飞区 因为卡扎菲在48小时内 没有飞机。 
 Instead of which, we've allowed ourselves to be tempted towards regime change. ||| 反之，我们没能承受住 改朝换代的诱惑。 
 In doing so, we've destroyed our credibility with the Security Council, which means it's very difficult to get a resolution on Syria, and we're setting ourselves up again for failure. ||| 这使得我们在安理会面前失去了信誉， 也给叙利亚决议的达成 难上加难， 我们再一次为自己埋下了失败的种子。 
 Once more, humility, limits, honesty, realistic expectations and we could have achieved something to be proud of. ||| 再次重申，谦逊态度， 自限，诚实， 切合实际的期望 我们是可以有所成就，并为之自豪的。 
 BG: Rory, thank you very much. ||| 罗伊，非常感谢你。 
 RS: Thank you. (BG: Thank you.) ||| 谢谢。 
 From all outward appearances, John had everything going for him. ||| 從所有表面來看， John事事都很順利。 
 He had just signed the contract to sell his New York apartment at a six-figure profit, and he'd only owned it for five years. ||| 他剛剛以六位數的利潤 簽售了他在紐約的公寓， 而他擁有呢套公寓 只不過五年時間。 
 The school where he graduated from with his master's had just offered him a teaching appointment, which meant not only a salary, but benefits for the first time in ages. ||| 他碩士畢業的學校 剛剛向他提供一份教書的職位， 呢個職位唔單只代表工資， 更意味著多年以來第一次的福利。 
 And yet, despite everything going really well for John, he was struggling, fighting addiction and a gripping depression. ||| 然而，儘管對於John來說事事順利， 他依然處於掙扎之中， 他在于毒癮和無法擺脫的抑鬱爭鬥。 
 On the night of June 11th, 2003, he climbed up to the edge of the fence on the Manhattan Bridge and he leaped to the treacherous waters below. ||| 2003年6月11日的夜晚， 他爬上了曼哈頓大橋 圍欄的邊緣， 縱身跳入橋下莫測的河水中。 
 Remarkably — no, miraculously — he lived. ||| 不可思議地 – 唔係，奇跡般地 – 他生還了。 
 The fall shattered his right arm, broke every rib that he had, punctured his lung, and he drifted in and out of consciousness as he drifted down the East River, under the Brooklyn Bridge and out into the pathway of the Staten Island Ferry, where passengers on the ferry heard his cries of pain, contacted the boat's captain who contacted the Coast Guard who fished him out of the East River and took him to Bellevue Hospital. ||| 墜落導致他的右臂粉碎， 他的每條肋骨都斷了， 他的肺被刺穿， 他順著河流漂到東河時， 時而清醒時而昏迷， 他漂到了布魯克林大橋下， 到了史帝登島渡輪的入口， 在那里渡輪上的乘客 聽到他痛苦的叫聲， 報告了船長， 船長報告了海岸警衛隊， 海岸警衛隊把他從東河打撈上來 并把他送到瞭貝爾維醫院。 
 And that's actually where our story begins. ||| 事實上這才是故事的開始。 
 Because once John committed himself to putting his life back together — first physically, then emotionally, and then spiritually — he found that there were very few resources available to someone who has attempted to end their life in the way that he did. ||| 因為一旦John承諾 重新振作 – 首先生理上，然後情緒上， 再到精神上 – 他發現只有很少可用資源 來幫助那些像他一樣曾經嘗試 以同樣的方式結束生命的人。 
 Research shows that 19 out of 20 people who attempt suicide will fail. ||| 研究發現 20個試圖自殺的人中 有19人 會失敗。 
 But the people who fail are 37 times more likely to succeed the second time. ||| 但是這些失敗的人 第二次自殺的成功機率 是37倍。 
 This truly is an at-risk population with very few resources to support them. ||| 這確實是 一群高危人群， 然而卻只有很少的資源去支持他們。 
 And what happens when people try to assemble themselves back into life, because of our taboos around suicide, we're not sure what to say, and so quite often we say nothing. ||| 對于那些 試著回到原來的生活的人又是怎樣的情況？ 因為我們對自殺的避忌， 我們不確定要說些什麼， 而很多時候我們什麼都沒有說。 
 And that furthers the isolation that people like John found themselves in. ||| 因此這樣就更加 令像John那樣的人覺得自己處於被孤立的狀態。 
 I know John's story very well because I'm John. ||| 我非常了解John的故事 因為我就是John。 
 And this is, today, the first time in any sort of public setting I've ever acknowledged the journey that I have been on. ||| 今天在這里， 是我每一次在公共場合 講述 我的經歷。 
 But after having lost a beloved teacher in 2006 and a good friend last year to suicide, and sitting last year at TEDActive, I knew that I needed to step out of my silence and past my taboos to talk about an idea worth spreading — and that is that people who have made the difficult choice to come back to life need more resources and need our help. ||| 然而在2006年失去一位敬愛的教師 以及上一年因自殺而失去的好友之後， 在參加了上一年的TEDActive之後， 我意識到自己需要站出來不再沈默， 克服我的避忌 來講述一個值得傳播的思想 – 即是那些 作出艱難抉擇 決定重新開始的人來說， 他們需要更多的資源以及我們的幫助。 
 As the Trevor Project says, it gets better. ||| 正如Trevor項目提倡的，一切都會好起來的。 
 It gets way better. ||| 會變得更好的。 
 And I'm choosing to come out of a totally different kind of closet today to encourage you, to urge you, that if you are someone who has contemplated or attempted suicide, or you know somebody who has, talk about it; get help. ||| 今天我選擇站出來 述說一個完全不同的人生， 來鼓勵大家，力勸大家， 如果你或者 你身邊認識的人 考慮過或嘗試過自殺， 請與人傾訴，尋求援助。 
 It's a conversation worth having and an idea worth spreading. ||| 這是一個值得討論的話題， 一個值得傳播的想法。 
 Thank you. ||| 多谢。 
 (Applause) ||| (掌声) 
 As a boy, I loved cars. ||| 細個果陣 我就鐘意汽車 
 When I turned 18, I lost my best friend to a car accident. ||| 18歲果陣 我最好噶一位朋友係車禍中喪生。 
 Like this. ||| 好似咁， 
 And then I decided I'd dedicate my life to saving one million people every year. ||| 於是決定投身 拯救每年 一百萬人噶生命 
 Now I haven't succeeded, so this is just a progress report, but I'm here to tell you a little bit about self-driving cars. ||| 目前還未成功，所以哩個只係一個進度報告， 今日我想同你地介紹噶係無人駕駛汽車。 
 I saw the concept first in the DARPA Grand Challenges where the U.S. government issued a prize to build a self-driving car that could navigate a desert. ||| 我第一次聽講哩個概念果陣係 美國政府係DARPA大挑戰中 懸賞建造一輛 可以在沙漠入邊導航噶無人駕駛汽車。 
 And even though a hundred teams were there, these cars went nowhere. ||| 即使當時有100家團隊， 果D汽車都未完成過。 
 So we decided at Stanford to build a different self-driving car. ||| 因此我決定係斯坦福大學建造一輛無人駕駛汽車。 
 We built the hardware and the software. ||| 我地搭建軟硬件。 
 We made it learn from us, and we set it free in the desert. ||| 令距向我地學習 同時自由係沙漠中奔馳。 
 And the unimaginable happened: it became the first car to ever return from a DARPA Grand Challenge, winning Stanford 2 million dollars. ||| 意想唔到噶事發生左： 距成爲左第一輛 可以完成DARPA大挑戰噶汽車—— 爲斯坦福大學贏到20萬美金。 
 Yet I still hadn't saved a single life. ||| 不過我仲係未能拯救到一條生命。 
 Since, our work has focused on building driving cars that can drive anywhere by themselves — any street in California. ||| 果次之後， 我地噶任務轉向左 可以在任何地方自動駕駛噶汽車—— 係加州任意一條街道上。 
 We've driven 140,000 miles. ||| 我地已經行駛左14萬英里。 
 Our cars have sensors by which they magically can see everything around them and make decisions about every aspect of driving. ||| 車上噶傳感器會 魔幻般檢視 周圍一切 同時會做出 駕駛方向決策。 
 It's the perfect driving mechanism. ||| 距噶駕駛技術太剄了。 
 We've driven in cities, like in San Francisco here. ||| 我地駛過 好似三藩市感噶城市， 
 We've driven from San Francisco to Los Angeles on Highway 1. ||| 我地係1好高速公路上從三藩市開到洛杉磯。 
 We've encountered joggers, busy highways, toll booths, and this is without a person in the loop; the car just drives itself. ||| 我地遇到過慢跑者、 繁忙噶高速公路、收費站， 成個過程都戲無人操縱噶； 汽車自己駕駛。 
 In fact, while we drove 140,000 miles, people didn't even notice. ||| 事實上，甚至無人注意到 我地駛過14萬英里 
 Mountain roads, day and night, and even crooked Lombard Street in San Francisco. ||| 無論係山路、 白天黑夜， 還係三藩市崎嶇噶 Lombard街道。 
 (Laughter) Sometimes our cars get so crazy, they even do little stunts. ||| （笑聲） 有時我地噶汽車會好瘋狂， 有D雜技表演噶味道。 
 (Video) Man: Oh, my God. ||| （視頻）A：噢，上帝！ 
 What? ||| 乜啊？ 
 Second Man: It's driving itself. ||| B:距自動駕駛緊 
 Sebastian Thrun: Now I can't get my friend Harold back to life, but I can do something for all the people who died. ||| ST：今日我無辦法令我噶朋友Harold重生， 但係我可以爲果D死去噶人做些野。 
 Do you know that driving accidents are the number one cause of death for young people? ||| 你知唔知交通意外係 年輕人死亡噶頭號殺手嗎？ 
 And do you realize that almost all of those are due to human error and not machine error, and can therefore be prevented by machines? ||| 你有無意識到 幾乎所有噶事故都係由於人爲錯誤 而唔係機器及其鼓掌導致嗎？ 你有無意識到我地可以通過機器來阻止感樣噶後果？ 
 Do you realize that we could change the capacity of highways by a factor of two or three if we didn't rely on human precision on staying in the lane — improve body position and therefore drive a little bit closer together on a little bit narrower lanes, and do away with all traffic jams on highways? ||| 你知唔知 假如我地唔再依賴人類 選擇車道噶精確度 可以將高速公路噶容納量 提高兩到三倍—— 優化車輛噶位置 令距地可以係較窄噶車道上 行駛， 以及減少高速公路上噶交通擠塞。 
 Do you realize that you, TED users, spend an average of 52 minutes per day in traffic, wasting your time on your daily commute? ||| 你有無意識到 你地平均每日 耗費52分鐘 係交通上， 浪費緊你每日噶 通勤時間？ 
 You could regain this time. ||| 你可以贏翻哩滴時間。 
 This is four billion hours wasted in this country alone. ||| 哩度有40億個鐘 同埋24億加倫汽油 
 And it's 2.4 billion gallons of gasoline wasted. ||| 浪費係哩個村莊裏。 
 Now I think there's a vision here, a new technology, and I'm really looking forward to a time when generations after us look back at us and say how ridiculous it was that humans were driving cars. ||| 現在覺得有一個夢想，一種新技術， 我好期待未來某一日 當下一代人回首過去睇翻我地果陣 距地會覺得人類駕駛汽車哩件事係幾咁荒謬。 
 Thank you. ||| 多謝大傢 
 (Applause) ||| （掌聲） 
 And we could start to imagine the experiences our buildings create. ||| 我哋可以想像 
 I think of our architecture as organizational structures. ||| 我會將我哋嘅建築物諗成係組織嘅結構 
 I still very much like this image. ||| 我仍然好鐘意呢幅圖 
 And this is how the building stands in Beijing today. ||| 呢個係佢依家喺北京嘅外貌 
 The building has become part of everyday life in Beijing. ||| 呢棟建築已經係北京生活嘅一部分 
 (Laughter) But its most important moment is maybe sill this one. ||| （笑聲） 但最重要嘅時刻可能係 當呢本《城市漫步》嘅週刊 
 This is a residential development in Singapore, large scale. ||| 呢個係一個係新加坡嘅大型住宅項目 
 And you see that these courtyards are not hermetically sealed spaces. ||| 呢啲花園並唔係密閉空間 
 This is, in fact, the 13th floor of one of these terraces. ||| 呢度係其中一棟樓嘅 13 樓 
 In the tropics, the sun is the most important thing to pay attention to, and, in fact, it is seeking protection from the sun. ||| 喺熱帶地區，太陽係最必須留意嘅嘢 而遮蔽陽光係建築需要做嘅嘢 
 Thank you. ||| 多謝 
 So this is my niece. ||| 呢個係我嘅姪女/外甥女 
 Her name is Yahli. ||| 佢叫做 Yahli 
 She is nine months old. ||| 佢依家 9 個月大 
 Her mum is a doctor, and her dad is a lawyer. ||| 佢嘅媽咪係醫生，爹哋係律師 
 By the time Yahli goes to college, the jobs her parents do are going to look dramatically different. ||| 等到 Yahli 去返大學嗰時 佢父母依家做嘅工作將會有巨變 
 In 2013, researchers at Oxford University did a study on the future of work. ||| 牛津大學嘅研究人員喺2013年 
 It's the most powerful branch of artificial intelligence. ||| 佢係人工智能最強勁嘅學科分支 
 It allows machines to learn from data and mimic some of the things that humans can do. ||| 佢令到機器可以從數據中學習 模仿有啲人類會做嘅事 
 My company, Kaggle, operates on the cutting edge of machine learning. ||| 我間公司 Kaggle 企喺機器學習嘅最前線 
 We bring together hundreds of thousands of experts to solve important problems for industry and academia. ||| 我哋匯聚咗成千上萬嘅專家 嚟解決工業、學術嘅重大問題

 And you all know roughly the story. ||| 呢個故事你哋或多或少都知道一點 
 Belshazzar, the son of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar who'd conquered Israel, sacked Jerusalem and captured the people and taken the Jews back to Babylon. ||| 伯沙撒喺尼布甲尼撒嘅仔 尼布甲尼撒征服咗以色列再劫掠耶路撒冷 俘虜當地人民 將猶太人 
 Not only the Jews, he'd taken the temple vessels. ||| 仲有神殿中嘅神器帶回巴比倫 
 He'd ransacked, desecrated the temple. ||| 他褻瀆神殿再搜刮神殿中嘅寶物 
 And the great gold vessels of the temple in Jerusalem had been taken to Babylon. ||| 耶路撒冷神殿中嘅大型金屬容器 都被帶回巴比倫 
 Belshazzar, his son, decides to have a feast. ||| 尼布甲尼撒嘅兒子伯沙撒 決定舉辦一場宴會 
 And in order to make it even more exciting, he added a bit of sacrilege to the rest of the fun, and he brings out the temple vessels. ||| 為咗要炒熱氣氛 他將褻瀆神嘅行為加入餘興節目當中 他拿起神器 
 He's already at war with the Iranians, with the king of Persia. ||| 當時佢哋正系度同伊朗人打仗 同波斯王打仗 
 "And that night, Daniel tells us, at the height of the festivities a hand appeared and wrote on the wall, ""You are weighed in the balance and found wanting, and your kingdom is handed over to the Medes and the Persians."" And that very night Cyrus, king of the Persians, entered Babylon and the whole regime of Belshazzar fell." ||| "果日晚上但以理將 喺宴會嘅關鍵時刻 出現咗一隻手，果隻手喺牆上寫道 ""你被秤系天平裏面，顯出你嘅虧欠 你嘅國要歸與 瑪代人和波斯人"" 就喺果晚 居魯士波斯之王向巴比倫出征 伯沙撒嘅王國毀於一旦" 
 It is, of course, a great moment in the history of the Jewish people. ||| 想當然 對於希伯來歷史嚟講 呢喺個非常重要嘅一刻 
 It's a great story. It's story we all know. ||| 呢真喺個好犀利嘅故事而我哋都知呢個故事 
 ""The writing on the wall" is part of our everyday language." ||| 牆上嘅字 就喺我哋現代用語中嘅一部分 
 What happened next was remarkable, and it's where our cylinder enters the story. ||| 接咯來所發生嘅事 十分精彩 而我哋剛才講嘅圓柱 就要出場 
 Cyrus, king of the Persians, has entered Babylon without a fight — the great empire of Babylon, which ran from central southern Iraq to the Mediterranean, falls to Cyrus. ||| 波斯王居魯士 不費一兵一卒就得到巴比倫 偉大嘅王國巴比倫 一路從南伊拉克中部 逃至到地中海 最後還是臣服於居魯士 
 And Cyrus makes a declaration. ||| 後來居魯士公布咗一項宣言 
 And that is what this cylinder is, the declaration made by the ruler guided by God who had toppled the Iraqi despot and was going to bring freedom to the people. ||| 果個宣言就刻喺呢個圓柱體上 這項宣言是由接受上帝指引嘅統治者頒布嘅 他不僅推翻咗伊拉克嘅暴君 更帶給人民自由 
 "In ringing Babylonian — it was written in Babylonian — he says, ""I am Cyrus, king of all the universe, the great king, the powerful king, king of Babylon, king of the four quarters of the world."" They're not shy of hyperbole as you can see." ||| 圓柱上嘅 巴比倫語寫上 朕乃居魯士 宇宙之王 偉大之王 強盛之王 朕乃巴比倫之王 世界之王 看來他們誇飾法用得一點也唔掩飾 
 This is probably the first real press release by a victorious army that we've got. ||| 呢應該喺 我們所獲嘅 第一份真正由勝利方 發布嘅新聞稿 
 And it's written, as we'll see in due course, by very skilled P.R. consultants. ||| 稍後我哋就知道 這是由經驗豐富嘅公關顧問寫出來嘅 
 So the hyperbole is not actually surprising. ||| 所以誇飾法用成甘樣也就沒咩大不了 
 And what is the great king, the powerful king, the king of the four quarters of the world going to do? ||| 甘接下來 那偉大之王 強盛之王 世界之王要做咩呢 
 He goes on to say that, having conquered Babylon, he will at once let all the peoples that the Babylonians — Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar — have captured and enslaved go free. ||| 他接著又講 巴比倫既已征服 他馬上要讓果D 被尼布甲尼撒與伯沙撒所俘虜 所奴役嘅異族人 重獲自由 
 He'll let them return to their countries. ||| 他要讓佢哋重回家鄉 
 And more important, he will let them all recover the gods, the statues, the temple vessels that had been confiscated. ||| 但更這要嘅喺 他還歸還咗果D 曾被沒收嘅 神像塑像 以及神器 
 All the peoples that the Babylonians had repressed and removed will go home, and they'll take with them their gods. ||| 所有被巴比倫人鎮壓，被俘虜嘅人 都可以迴歸 都能同佢哋嘅神一同離去 
 And they'll be able to restore their altars and to worship their gods in their own way, in their own place. ||| 他們都能重修祭壇 以他們嘅方式 在屬於他們的地方，崇敬他們的神 
 This is the decree, this object is the evidence for the fact that the Jews, after the exile in Babylon, the years they'd spent sitting by the waters of Babylon, weeping when they remembered Jerusalem, those Jews were allowed to go home. ||| 就是呢個法令 這就是最好嘅證物 它證明咗猶太人 流亡巴比倫後 坐喺巴比倫水邊，詠懷耶路撒冷 不停啜泣嘅果段歲月 而最後，佢哋終於重獲自由 
 They were allowed to return to Jerusalem and to rebuild the temple. ||| 他們得以返回耶路撒冷 重建神殿 
 It's a central document in Jewish history. ||| 呢喺猶太歷史中嘅 核心文獻 
 And the Book of Chronicles, the Book of Ezra in the Hebrew scriptures reported in ringing terms. ||| 在希伯來經文中嘅，歷代志同以斯拉記之中 都詳盡記下呢一切 
 This is the Jewish version of the same story. ||| 呢喺同一個故事 只是是猶太版本嘅 
 """Thus said Cyrus, king of Persia, 'All the kingdoms of the earth have the Lord God of heaven given thee, and he has charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem." ||| """波斯王古列（居魯士）如此說 '耶和華天上的神 已將天下萬國賜給我 又囑咐我 在猶大的耶路撒冷為他建造殿宇" 
 Who is there among you of his people? ||| 你們中間凡作他子民嘅 
 "The Lord God be with him, and let him go up.'"" ""Go up"" — aaleh." ||| "可以上去 願耶和華他的神與他同在'"" 上去 重回故國" 
 The central element, still, of the notion of return, a central part of the life of Judaism. ||| 重返耶路撒冷呢個想法嘅 核心元素 依然是猶太教文化嘅 核心思想 
 As you all know, that return from exile, the second temple, reshaped Judaism. ||| 相信大家都知道 耶路撒冷的回歸與第二神殿 重新塑造咗猶太教 
 And that change, that great historic moment, was made possible by Cyrus, the king of Persia, reported for us in Hebrew in scripture and in Babylonian in clay. ||| 波斯王居魯士實現咗 呢個轉機 呢歷史上嘅重要一刻 希伯來文嘅經文，巴比倫語嘅陶器 都詳細記載咗這一切 
 Two great texts, what about the politics? ||| 兩份都是好重要嘅文獻 甘政治方面又喺點呢 
 What was going on was the fundamental shift in Middle Eastern history. ||| 接下來發生嘅事 對中東歷史產生咗重大嘅轉變 
 The empire of Iran, the Medes and the Persians, united under Cyrus, became the first great world empire. ||| 居魯士統一 瑪代人與波斯人嘅伊朗 建立咗第一個世界性大帝國 
 Cyrus begins in the 530s BC. ||| 居魯士嘅霸業從西元前530年開始 
 And by the time of his son Darius, the whole of the eastern Mediterranean is under Persian control. ||| 及至其子大流士時 整個東地中海地區 都已經納入咗波斯帝國版圖 
 This empire is, in fact, the Middle East as we now know it, and it's what shapes the Middle East as we now know it. ||| 事實上，呢個帝國統治咗 我們宜家所知嘅中東地區 因為有呢個帝國先至有宜家嘅中東地區 
 It was the largest empire the world had known until then. ||| 它喺當時世界上最大嘅帝國 
 Much more important, it was the first multicultural, multifaith state on a huge scale. ||| 更重要嘅是 它喺第一個 大規模融合咗多元文化 與多元信仰嘅國家 
 And it had to be run in a quite new way. ||| 它必須以新嘅方式治理 
 It had to be run in different languages. ||| 必須以各種語言傳達政令 
 The fact that this decree is in Babylonian says one thing. ||| 巴比倫語版本嘅政令就證明了真有此事 
 And it had to recognize their different habits, different peoples, different religions, different faiths. ||| 它必須承認在系同個國家裡面 會有不同的習俗，不同的種族，不同宗教，不同信仰 
 All of those are respected by Cyrus. ||| 居魯士尊重呢D差異 
 Cyrus sets up a model of how you run a great multinational, multifaith, multicultural society. ||| 居魯士設立咗典範 教我們點樣治理 一個蘊含多元種族，多元信仰，多元文化嘅社會 
 And the result of that was an empire that included the areas you see on the screen, and which survived for 200 years of stability until it was shattered by Alexander. ||| 結果就是 他建立咗一個橫跨許多地區嘅大帝國，就好似你們在螢幕上見到嘅一樣 呢個帝國維持咗200年之久嘅穩定強盛 直到被亞歷山大征服 
 It left a dream of the Middle East as a unit, and a unit where people of different faiths could live together. ||| 呢個帝國為中東嘅統一留下咗一個夢 一個不同信仰嘅人 都可以共同生活嘅夢 
 The Greek invasions ended that. ||| 但喺希臘人嘅入侵粉碎咗呢一切 
 And of course, Alexander couldn't sustain a government and it fragmented. ||| 當然亞歷山大無力維持政權 呢個帝國隨後便四分五裂 
 But what Cyrus represented remained absolutely central. ||| 但居魯士所代表嘅 仍喺絕對嘅核心意義 
 "The Greek historian Xenophon wrote his book ""Cyropaedia"" promoting Cyrus as the great ruler." ||| 在希臘史學家色諾芬所寫嘅 居魯士嘅教育一書中 他推崇居魯士喺個偉大嘅統治者 
 And throughout European culture afterward, Cyrus remained the model. ||| 在後來嘅整個歐洲文化中 居魯士仍然喺個不朽嘅典範 
 This is a 16th century image to show you how widespread his veneration actually was. ||| 這是16世紀時嘅形象 用以證明人們 推崇他嘅程度究竟有多廣 
 And Xenophon's book on Cyrus on how you ran a diverse society was one of the great textbooks that inspired the Founding Fathers of the American Revolution. ||| 色諾芬在書中描述咗 居魯士如何治理一個多元嘅社會 而這本偉大嘅書 啟發了美國革命嘅 諸位國父 
 Jefferson was a great admirer — the ideals of Cyrus obviously speaking to those 18th century ideals of how you create religious tolerance in a new state. ||| 傑佛遜就是其中一位仰慕者 居魯士證明咗 要如何喺 18世紀嘅新國度當中 創造宗教寬容嘅氛圍 
 Meanwhile, back in Babylon, things had not been going well. ||| 宜家等我哋返到巴比倫 但情況似乎不太樂觀 
 After Alexander, the other empires, Babylon declines, falls into ruins, and all the traces of the great Babylonian empire are lost — until 1879 when the cylinder is discovered by a British Museum exhibition digging in Babylon. ||| 喺亞歷山大之後有幾位君主 令巴比倫日漸衰頹只遺留落頹垣敗瓦 所有能夠證明巴比倫曾經強盛嘅蛛絲馬跡，都已經消失匿跡 直到1879年 大英博物館為咗展覽 喺巴比倫挖出呢個圓柱 
 And it enters now another story. ||| 現在又喺另一個故事啦 
 It enters that great debate in the middle of the 19th century: Are the scriptures reliable? Can we trust them? ||| 19世紀中葉時 曾有一場大規模嘅辯論 經文真嘅可信嗎，我哋應該相信經文嗎？ 
 We only knew about the return of the Jews and the decree of Cyrus from the Hebrew scriptures. ||| 從希伯來經文中 我哋只能瞭解到 猶太人嘅回歸同居魯士嘅法令 
 No other evidence. ||| 無其他證據 
 Suddenly, this appeared. ||| 突然它嘅出現 
 And great excitement to a world where those who believed in the scriptures had had their faith in creation shaken by evolution, by geology, here was evidence that the scriptures were historically true. ||| 對當時 相信經文與創世紀 卻被演化論同地質學所動搖嘅人來講 它帶來咗多麼大嘅震撼 它證實咗 經文在歷史上喺真實存在嘅 
 It's a great 19th century moment. ||| 呢是19世紀嘅偉大時刻 
 But — and this, of course, is where it becomes complicated — the facts were true, hurrah for archeology, but the interpretation was rather more complicated. ||| 但當然，從此以後，事情越來越複雜 事實都是真嘅 在考古學上無疑喺好消息 但要點樣去詮釋，卻喺更加困難的課題 
 Because the cylinder account and the Hebrew Bible account differ in one key respect. ||| 因為圓柱所陳述嘅，同希伯來經文中陳述嘅 有個關鍵嘅差異 
 The Babylonian cylinder is written by the priests of the great god of Bablyon, Marduk. ||| 圓柱體上嘅巴比倫語 喺由信奉巴比倫之神 馬爾杜克嘅祭司所寫嘅 
 And, not surprisingly, they tell you that all this was done by Marduk. ||| 所以可想而知 他們會說，呢一切都喺馬爾杜克嘅神蹟 
 ""Marduk, we hold, called Cyrus by his name."" ||| 馬爾杜克-我哋所信奉嘅神，以祂嘅名，召喚居魯士 
 Marduk takes Cyrus by the hand, calls him to shepherd his people and gives him the rule of Babylon. ||| 馬爾杜克拉著居魯士嘅手 命他帶領他嘅子民 並授予他統治巴比倫嘅權力 
 Marduk tells Cyrus that he will do these great, generous things of setting the people free. ||| 馬爾杜克告訴居魯士講話 他會釋放果D異族人民 多麼偉大而慷慨嘅壯舉 
 And this is why we should all be grateful to and worship Marduk. ||| 這就是我們要感激 並且崇拜馬爾杜克嘅原因 
 The Hebrew writers in the Old Testament, you will not be surprised to learn, take a rather different view of this. ||| 而在希伯來嘅舊約聖經中 對此卻有 截然不同嘅看法 但這也沒咩好驚奇嘅 
 For them, of course, it can't possibly by Marduk that made all this happen. ||| 想當然, 對佢哋而言 呢一切絕不可能喺馬爾杜克嘅功勞 
 It can only be Jehovah. ||| 只能喺耶和華嘅神蹟 
 And so in Isaiah, we have the wonderful texts giving all the credit of this, not to Marduk but to the Lord God of Israel — the Lord God of Israel who also called Cyrus by name, also takes Cyrus by the hand and talks of him shepherding his people. ||| 在以賽亞書中嘅描述都是甘樣 功勞皆屬 以色列之主 而唔系馬爾杜克 而系以色列之主 以色列之主 同樣召喚咗居魯士 同樣拉住居魯士嘅手 也同樣命他管好他嘅子民 
 It's a remarkable example of two different priestly appropriations of the same event, two different religious takeovers of a political fact. ||| 呢系個絕佳嘅例子 講明咗同一件事，卻可以有不同嘅宗教詮釋 同一個政治事件 卻可以有不同嘅宗教描述 
 God, we know, is usually on the side of the big battalions. ||| 我們都知道 神總是站在強大嘅一方 
 The question is, which god was it? ||| 問題喺到底邊個個神做嘅 
 And the debate unsettles everybody in the 19th century to realize that the Hebrew scriptures are part of a much wider world of religion. ||| 呢場辯論，將19世紀搞得人心惶惶 都使大家瞭解到 希伯來經文只喺 偌大嘅宗教世界中嘅一小部分 
 And it's quite clear the cylinder is older than the text of Isaiah, and yet, Jehovah is speaking in words very similar to those used by Marduk. ||| 可以確定嘅是 圓柱比以賽亞書還仲早出現 而耶和華所使用嘅語言 與馬爾杜克所使用嘅 十分類似 
 "And there's a slight sense that Isaiah knows this, because he says, this is God speaking, of course, ""I have called thee by thy name though thou hast not known me."" I think it's recognized that Cyrus doesn't realize that he's acting under orders from Jehovah." ||| "以賽亞知道這件事 應該仲算合理 因為佢管當然喺神講嘅 ""你雖不認識我 我也加給你名號"" 我惗大家都會承認 居魯士並不知道 他其實喺依照耶和華嘅指令行事" 
 And equally, he'd have been surprised that he was acting under orders from Marduk. ||| 同樣，如果佢知道佢系聽咗馬爾杜克嘅話先做呢件事，他會嚇一大跳 
 Because interestingly, of course, Cyrus is a good Iranian with a totally different set of gods who are not mentioned in any of these texts. ||| 因為很有趣嘅系 居魯士喺個純百分之百嘅伊朗人 對於神佢哋自有一套完全不同嘅說法 而喺呢兩份經文中，根本就無提過他們嘅神 
 (Laughter) That's 1879. ||| (笑聲) 呢喺系1879年發生嘅事 
 40 years on and we're in 1917, and the cylinder enters a different world. ||| 40年過去 我們來到1917年 而呢個圓柱體又進入另一個世界 
 This time, the real politics of the contemporary world — the year of the Balfour Declaration, the year when the new imperial power in the Middle East, Britain, decides that it will declare a Jewish national home, it will allow the Jews to return. ||| 宜家已經可以算喺 現代世界嘅真實政治時代 呢一年，發表貝爾福宣言 呢一年，中東同英國嘅新興帝國勢力崛起 決議建立一個 猶太人嘅國家 允許猶太人 回歸家園 
 And the response to this by the Jewish population in Eastern Europe is rhapsodic. ||| 東歐的嘅猶太人對呢件事 反應十分熱烈，幾乎到咗瘋狂嘅地步 
 And across Eastern Europe, Jews display pictures of Cyrus and of George V side by side — the two great rulers who have allowed the return to Jerusalem. ||| 橫跨整個東歐 猶太人並列展示咗 居魯士 與喬治五世嘅畫像 因為呢兩位偉大君王都允許 猶太人回歸耶路撒冷 
 And the Cyrus cylinder comes back into public view and the text of this as a demonstration of why what is going to happen after the war is over in 1918 is part of a divine plan. ||| 呢時居魯士圓柱又吸引咗大眾嘅目光 上面嘅文字紀錄，被視為神嘅旨意中一部份 說明咗戰後所發生嘅事 點解系1918年先宣告結束 而接落嚟又會發生咩事 
 You all know what happened. ||| 我想大家都知道，接落嚟發生D咩事 
 The state of Israel is setup, and 50 years later, in the late 60s, it's clear that Britain's role as the imperial power is over. ||| 以色列建國 而50年後，時間到咗1960年代晚期 英國顯然失去咗，佢喺新興帝國勢力之中嘅地位 
 And another story of the cylinder begins. ||| 關於呢個圓柱體嘅另一段故事，就此展開 
 The region, the U.K. and the U.S. decide, has to be kept safe from communism, and the superpower that will be created to do this would be Iran, the Shah. ||| 英國同美國決議 唔令民族國家受到共產主義嘅荼毒 而能夠保護民族國家，即將誕生嘅伊朗 由沙阿領導嘅超級強國-伊朗 
 And so the Shah invents an Iranian history, or a return to Iranian history, that puts him in the center of a great tradition and produces coins showing himself with the Cyrus cylinder. ||| 因此沙阿間接創造咗伊朗歷史 或者系他回歸歷史嘅本質 他讓自己成為伊朗偉大傳統嘅核心 下令發行 刻有自己肖像 以及居魯士圓柱嘅硬幣 
 When he has his great celebrations in Persepolis, he summons the cylinder and the cylinder is lent by the British Museum, goes to Tehran, and is part of those great celebrations of the Pahlavi dynasty. ||| 他喺波斯波利斯舉行慶典時 他希望居魯士圓柱能回歸伊朗 於是大英博物館借出圓柱 運往德黑蘭成立巴列為王朝 偉大慶典中嘅一部分 
 Cyrus cylinder: guarantor of the Shah. ||| 居魯士圓柱就系沙阿權力嘅保證 
 10 years later, another story: Iranian Revolution, 1979. ||| 10年過後發生咗另一段故事 1979年嘅伊朗革命 
 Islamic revolution, no more Cyrus; we're not interested in that history, we're interested in Islamic Iran — until Iraq, the new superpower that we've all decided should be in the region, attacks. ||| 唔再講居魯士圓柱，伊斯蘭革命先系主角 我們對果段歷史唔感興趣 我們有興趣嘅系伊斯蘭文化下嘅伊朗 直到伊拉克 呢個我們都認為，應該出現系這個地區嘅新興強權國家 對伊朗發動攻擊 
 Then another Iran-Iraq war. ||| 呢又系另一場兩伊戰爭 
 And it becomes critical for the Iranians to remember their great past, their great past when they fought Iraq and won. ||| 伊朗與伊拉克打仗果陣 獲勝嘅關鍵就系 伊朗人永遠記得他們嘅過去 果段輝煌嘅過去 
 It becomes critical to find a symbol that will pull together all Iranians — Muslims and non-Muslims, Christians, Zoroastrians, Jews living in Iran, people who are devout, not devout. ||| 一定得揾到一個團結嘅象徵 先可以令所有伊朗人團結一致 不管系唔系伊斯蘭教徒 不管系基督教徒，祆教徒，或者猶太人唔論虔誠與否 只要是住在伊朗嘅人，都是伊朗人，都必須團結起來 
 And the obvious emblem is Cyrus. ||| 顯然，居魯士圓柱就系團結嘅象徵 
 So when the British Museum and Tehran National Musuem cooperate and work together, as we've been doing, the Iranians ask for one thing only as a loan. ||| 所以當大英博物館與德黑來國家博物館合作時 就系我哋一直以來都系度做嘅一樣 伊朗人 只同我哋借一樣嘢 
 It's the only object they want. ||| 他們只想要呢樣嘢 
 They want to borrow the Cyrus cylinder. ||| 佢哋想要借嘅就系居魯士圓柱 
 And last year, the Cyrus cylinder went to Tehran for the second time. ||| 舊年 居魯士圓柱 第二次被運往德黑蘭 
 It's shown being presented here, put into its case by the director of the National Museum of Tehran, one of the many women in Iran in very senior positions, Mrs. Ardakani. ||| 正如你哋能見到嘅 它是由德黑蘭國家博物館的館長親手放進盒子裡的 喺艾達卡妮女士 喺伊朗婦女中地位相當崇高 
 It was a huge event. ||| 這可系一件大事 
 This is the other side of that same picture. ||| 呢系另一張相片，但拍攝角度相反 
 It's seen in Tehran by between one and two million people in the space of a few months. ||| 幾個月之後 已經有一兩百萬人來過呢度 來一睹居魯士圓柱嘅風采 
 This is beyond any blockbuster exhibition in the West. ||| 甘樣嘅盛況空前 超越西方所舉辦嘅任何一場展覽 
 And it's the subject of a huge debate about what this cylinder means, what Cyrus means, but above all, Cyrus as articulated through this cylinder — Cyrus as the defender of the homeland, the champion, of course, of Iranian identity and of the Iranian peoples, tolerant of all faiths. ||| 它都系一場辯論嘅主角 辯論嘅主題喺居魯士圓柱真正的嘅內涵何解，居魯士真正想表達嘅系乜 但最重要嘅系就像圓柱所描述嘅居魯士 居魯士系守衛家園嘅勇士 他為伊朗嘅認同，為伊朗各民族 為包容所有信仰而戰 他系贏家 
 And in the current Iran, Zoroastrians and Christians have guaranteed places in the Iranian parliament, something to be very, very proud of. ||| 系現代伊朗議會中 祆教徒同基督教徒都有保留席位 呢系很值得驕傲嘅一件事 
 To see this object in Tehran, thousands of Jews living in Iran came to Tehran to see it. ||| 數以千計嘅猶太人 從伊朗趕到德黑蘭 就為咗看看居魯士圓柱嘅廬山真面目 
 It became a great emblem, a great subject of debate about what Iran is at home and abroad. ||| 它系一個偉大嘅象徵 都系辯論會嘅主角 伊朗對內與對外嘅真正意義為何 
 Is Iran still to be the defender of the oppressed? ||| 伊朗會不會，再次為果D被欺壓嘅人民，挺身而出 
 Will Iran set free the people that the tyrants have enslaved and expropriated? ||| 伊朗會不會等果D 被暴君奴役，被暴君剝削嘅人們，重獲自由 
 This is heady national rhetoric, and it was all put together in a great pageant launching the return. ||| 呢系一場振奮人心嘅全國性議題 喺歡慶回歸嘅盛會之中 所有嘅議題 都被放在一齊討論 
 Here you see this out-sized Cyrus cylinder on the stage with great figures from Iranian history gathering to take their place in the heritage of Iran. ||| 呢系放大版嘅居魯士圓柱 為咗要系伊朗嘅後繼歷史中 保有一席之地 它同伊朗歷史中嘅偉人一齊登臺 
 It was a narrative presented by the president himself. ||| 呢系伊朗總統 親自發表嘅演講 
 And for me, to take this object to Iran, to be allowed to take this object to Iran was to be allowed to be part of an extraordinary debate led at the highest levels about what Iran is, what different Irans there are and how the different histories of Iran might shape the world today. ||| 對我而言 能夠將居魯士圓柱 帶返伊朗 就代表能成為 一場偉大辯論嘅一部分 以學術嘅最高度 探討伊朗嘅定位 不同嘅伊朗有何意義 不同嘅伊朗歷史 又點樣能塑造今日嘅世界 
 It's a debate that's still continuing, and it will continue to rumble, because this object is one of the great declarations of a human aspiration. ||| 呢場辯論仲沒結束 它唔會默默無言 因為居魯士圓柱 是人類渴望自由嘅 偉大聲明之一 
 It stands with the American constitution. ||| 佢同美國憲法具有同等效力 
 It certainly says far more about real freedoms than Magna Carta. ||| 佢肯定比大憲章 更能陳述何謂真正嘅自由 
 It is a document that can mean so many things, for Iran and for the region. ||| 呢份文獻能夠有很多層嘅意義 對伊朗，對這整個中東地區，都有不同嘅意義 
 A replica of this is at the United Nations. ||| 居魯士圓柱嘅複製品 被存放系聯合國 
 In New York this autumn, it will be present when the great debates about the future of the Middle East take place. ||| 今年秋天系紐約 系討論中東未來嘅辯論會上 你們能看見它嘅身影 
 And I want to finish by asking you what the next story will be in which this object figures. ||| 我希望以一個問題 為我今日嘅演講畫下句點 居魯士圓柱接落嚟會產生乜新故事呢 
 It will appear, certainly, in many more Middle Eastern stories. ||| 可以肯定喺 居魯士圓柱會成為更多中東故事嘅一部分 
 And what story of the Middle East, what story of the world, do you want to see reflecting what is said, what is expressed in this cylinder? ||| 而你們希望 中東會有點樣嘅故事 世界上會有點樣嘅故事 能夠體現居魯士圓柱所說嘅 所想要表達嘅意涵 
 The right of peoples to live together in the same state, worshiping differently, freely — a Middle East, a world, in which religion is not the subject of division or of debate. ||| 不同種族，不同信仰嘅人民 能夠喺同一個國家自由生活嘅權利 無論系中東 或者系世界嘅任何一角落 宗教信仰不會再系引發分裂 或引發爭論嘅原因了 
 In the world of the Middle East at the moment, the debates are, as you know, shrill. ||| 系宜家嘅中東世界 呢場爭論，依然激烈 
 But I think it's possible that the most powerful and the wisest voice of all of them may well be the voice of this mute thing, the Cyrus cylinder. ||| 但我相信 在佢哋之中，最明智，最強大嘅聲音 可能會代替呢把聲 無言嘅居魯士圓柱 嘅發聲 
 Thank you. ||| 謝謝 
 (Applause) ||| (掌聲) 
 Hi, my name is Marcin — farmer, technologist. ||| 嗨，我的名字是Marcin 是個農夫，也是技術專家 
 I was born in Poland, now in the U.S. ||| 我在波蘭出生，現在則在美國 
 I started a group called Open Source Ecology. ||| 我創立了一個名為Open Source Ecology的團隊 
 We've identified the 50 most important machines that we think it takes for modern life to exist — things from tractors, bread ovens, circuit makers. ||| 我們已經鑒別出維持現代生活運轉 所需五十種最重要既機器 例如拖拉機 多士爐, 電路製造機 
 Then we set out to create an open source, DIY, do it yourself version that anyone can build and maintain at a fraction of the cost. ||| 然後我們創設了資源共享, DIY, 自己動手做的版本 也就是任何人都能建造 並以少數花費來維護的機器 
 We call this the Global Village Construction Set. ||| 我們稱這為全球村建構集 
 So let me tell you a story. ||| 讓我來說個故事 
 So I finished my 20s with a Ph.D. in fusion energy, and I discovered I was useless. ||| 在我二十歲時 我獲得了融合能源的博士學位 我了解到我根本一無是處 
 I had no practical skills. ||| 我沒有任何的實質技能 
 The world presented me with options, and I took them. ||| 世界給了我不同的選擇 我也接受了 
 I guess you can call it the consumer lifestyle. ||| 我想你們可以說那是消費者的生活方式 
 So I started a farm in Missouri and learned about the economics of farming. ||| 所以我開始在密蘇里當起了農夫 並且學習經營農場的經濟學 
 I bought a tractor — then it broke. ||| 我買了台拖拉機, 然後它壞了 
 I paid to get it repaired — then it broke again. ||| 我花了錢將它修復好 然後它又壞了 
 Then pretty soon, I was broke too. ||| 沒多久 我也跟著沒錢了 
 I realized that the truly appropriate, low-cost tools that I needed to start a sustainable farm and settlement just didn't exist yet. ||| 我瞭解到 我需要真正合適, 低成本的工具 來打造出一個還不存在的 永續農場和住所 
 I needed tools that were robust, modular, highly efficient and optimized, low-cost, made from local and recycled materials that would last a lifetime, not designed for obsolescence. ||| 我需要堅固的, 模組化的 高效率並最佳化 低成本, 以當地可回收材料做成的工具 而不只是設計用來作為過渡用 
 I found that I would have to build them myself. ||| 我瞭解到我必須自己建造它們 
 So I did just that. ||| 而我也就這麼做了 
 And I tested them. ||| 並且測試它們 
 And I found that industrial productivity can be achieved on a small scale. ||| 我瞭解到工業化的生產效率 是可以小量的達成 
 So then I published the 3D designs, schematics, instructional videos and budgets on a wiki. ||| 所以我在維基創立3D設計, 解析圖, 操作指南影片 和預算 
 Then contributors from all over the world began showing up, prototyping new machines during dedicated project visits. ||| 而之後世界各地的贊助者開始出現 並在造訪我們的計畫中 創造多種新的原創機器 
 So far, we have prototyped eight of the 50 machines. ||| 到目前為止, 我們的五十種機器中有八項是原創設計 
 And now the project is beginning to grow on its own. ||| 而現在這個計畫 正開始自我茁壯 
 We know that open source has succeeded with tools for managing knowledge and creativity. ||| 我們知道資源共享是藉由軟體的使用 來駕馭知識與創意而成功 
 And the same is starting to happen with hardware too. ||| 而相同的事正開始發生在硬體上 
 We're focusing on hardware because it is hardware that can change people's lives in such tangible material ways. ||| 我們著眼在硬體 因為正是硬體設施這樣實質形體的事物 能改變人的生活 
 If we can lower the barriers to farming, building, manufacturing, then we can unleash just massive amounts of human potential. ||| 如果我們能降低耕作, 建築, 製造的成本 我們就能釋放出人類大量的潛能 
 That's not only in the developing world. ||| 这不仅仅针对发展中国家。 
 Our tools are being made for the American farmer, builder, entrepreneur, maker. ||| 美國的農夫, 建築業者, 企業家, 生產者 也建構出我們的機器 
 We've seen lots of excitement from these people, who can now start a construction business, parts manufacturing, organic CSA or just selling power back to the grid. ||| 我們看見了這些人 因能開創一個建構事業 或者是製造業 有機 CSA 或僅僅販售這些機器而感到開心興奮 
 Our goal is a repository of published designs so clear, so complete, that a single burned DVD is effectively a civilization starter kit. ||| 我們的目標是一份已知設計的知識寶典 如此的簡單, 如此的完整 只要一片DVD 就收錄著文明開創的成套設備 
 I've planted a hundred trees in a day. ||| 我曾在一天中種了一百顆樹 
 I've pressed 5,000 bricks in one day from the dirt beneath my feet and built a tractor in six days. ||| 我曾在一天中將我腳下的土 壓製成五千塊磚頭 並在六天內建造出一台拖拉機 
 From what I've seen, this is only the beginning. ||| 在我眼裡, 這些都只是個開始 
 If this idea is truly sound, then the implications are significant. ||| 如果這點子真的管用 那它的影響一定十分重大 
 A greater distribution of the means of production, environmentally sound supply chains, and a newly relevant DIY maker culture can hope to transcend artificial scarcity. ||| 製造的意義將能有更好的分佈, 聽起來更環保的供應鏈, 和一個全新價值的DIY製造者文化 期望能優於 過往過度工業化的製程 
 We're exploring the limits of what we all can do to make a better world with open hardware technology. ||| 我們正探索著 藉由硬體科技資源共享 使世界更好的極限 
 Thank you. ||| 謝謝 
 (Applause) ||| （鼓掌） 
 Everything is interconnected. ||| 所有嘢都係有關係嘅 
 There were no clouds in the sky. ||| 天空完全冇雲 
 That's part of you up there. ||| 嗰個就係你嘅一部分。 
 My hair used to be straight. ||| 因為我嘅頭髮以前係直㗎 
 All my relations. Thank you. ||| 所以全部嘢都係有關嘅。多謝 
 (Applause) ||| （掌聲） 
 I worked on forestry issues in WWF. ||| 我曾經係世界自然基金會 做過林業嘅工作 
 About 25 years in total, and then three years ago, I found myself talking to IKEA's CEO about joining his team. ||| 經過一共 25 年嘅工作 三年前，我同宜家家居嘅總裁講 想加入佢嘅隊伍 
 But first, let's just take three numbers. ||| 但首先，等我哋睇下￼三個數字 
 This is the number of people joining the global middle class by 2030, coming out of poverty. ||| 呢個數字表示到 2030 年 全球將會有三十億人脫離貧窮 加入中產階級 
 It's fantastic for them and their families, but we've got two billion people in the global middle class today, and this swells that number to five, a big challenge when we already have resource scarcity. ||| 對於佢哋同佢哋家人嚟講，係非常好 但全世界已經有二十億中產人士 所以總數會增加到五十億 喺我哋資源缺乏下，情況更加嚴峻 
 It's not inevitable, but we need to act decisively. ||| 呢個唔係無可避免，但我哋要果斷行動 
 That was in the beginning of the last century. ||| 講緊係上個世紀頭嘅時候 只有十二個城市 
 So just 12 cities. She was born in Manchester, England, the ninth largest city in the world. ||| 我阿嫲喺曼徹斯特出世 曼徹斯特係嗰時 全世界第九大城市 
 Every other century was kind of practice, and this lays down a blueprint for how we live. ||| 每一個世紀都好似有一樣嘢要做 呢個世紀就係我哋定下 下一幅生活藍圖 
 Sustainability has gone from a nice-to-do to a must-do. ||| 可持續發展已經由「做下都唔錯」 變成「必須要做」 
 We know from asking people from China to the U.S. ||| 我哋訪問中國同美國嘅人 
 Can I pay the bills at the end of the month? ||| 我月尾還唔還得曬帳單？ 
 Then they care about big issues like climate change. ||| 之後佢哋就關心大問題，例如氣候變化 
 It wasn't a great start. ||| 但咁樣似乎唔係 可持續發展嘅好開始 
 The LED is the next best thing to daylight. ||| LED 係僅次於日光嘅最好發光物體 
 They produced heat and a little bit of light on the side. ||| 佢哋發出好少光，但產生大量熱力 
 Now we have lights that produce light and a little bit of heat on the side. ||| 而家我哋嘅燈可以發出好多光 但同時只有非常小嘅熱力 
 You'll change your smartphone seven or eight times, probably more if you're in this audience. ||| 你會換七至八次手機 呢度嘅觀眾或者換得更加多 
 You'll change your car, if you have one, three or four times. ||| 如果你有渣車，你一世會換三至四次車 
 We will go all in. ||| 我哋會盡全力賣 LED 
 And there's opportunities in a circular economy. ||| 我哋嘅循環經濟先至會有機遇 
 But we're still dependent on natural, raw materials. ||| 但我哋依然依賴自然原料 
 Let's take cotton. ||| 睇下棉花 
 It's a brilliant textile in use. ||| 佢係非常好嘅紡織物 
 It's really dirty in production. ||| 但生產過程就好污糟 
 It uses lots of pesticides, lots of fertilizer, lots of water. ||| 佢用到好多殺蟲劑、化肥、水 
 Yields increase, and you halve the input costs. ||| 收入增加，成本又減半 
 Again, we're going all-in. ||| 同樣，我哋盡曬全力 
 By 2015, we'll be 100 percent Better Cotton. ||| 去到 2015 
 So hundreds of others, of NGOs, of forest workers' unions, and of businesses, have helped create the Forest Stewardship Council, which sets standards for forestry and then checks the forestry's good on the ground. ||| 過百個組織，包括非盈利組織 森林工作者聯盟同埋企業 一齊成立咗森林管理委員會 制定林業準則 確保林業健康發展 
 Use your supply chain to drive good. ||| 用自身嘅供應鏈去推動環保 
 But then it comes to your operations. ||| 跟住落嚟就係實行 
 Some things are certain, I think. ||| 我覺得有啲嘢係好明確 
 We know we'll use electricity in 20 or 30 years' time. ||| 當我哋知道我哋 嚟緊二、三十年仲會用電 
 So why not make our energy out of the sun and the wind? ||| 咁點解唔利用太陽同風去發電呢？ 
 By 2020, we'll produce more renewable energy than the energy we consume as a business. ||| 到 2020 年 比我哋公司需要嘅更多 
 But think of a solar panel. ||| 諗下一塊太陽能板 可以喺七至八年內回到本 
 Every business can do things like this. ||| 每間公司都可以咁樣做 
 And it was clearly totally unacceptable, so then you have to act. ||| 好明顯呢種情況係接受唔到 
 If you're not measuring things, you don't care and you don't know. ||| 如果你唔檢討 表示你唔關心，亦唔會了解 
 And we do not want to wait another hundred years. ||| 我哋唔想再等多一百年 
 So we've gone from sustainability being a nice-to-do to a must-do. It's a must-do. ||| 我哋嘅可持續發展 由以前「做下都幾唔錯」 到家下「必須做」 
 Be a discerning consumer. ||| 做一個有辨別能力嘅消費者 
 Vote with your wallets. ||| 用你嘅銀包去表態 
 I mentioned renewable energy. ||| 我提過可再生能源 
 You go to Google or Lego, they're going 100 percent renewable too, in the same way that we are. ||| 你去 Google 或者 Lego 公司 佢哋已經做緊百分百可再生能源 就好似我哋咁 
 (Applause) ||| （掌聲） 
 So just by a show of hands, how many of you all have a robot at home? ||| 如果你屋企有機械人嘅，就請舉高手 
 Not very many of you. ||| 唔係好多人 
 Okay. And actually of those hands, if you don't include Roomba how many of you have a robot at home? ||| 好。咁嗰啲舉咗手嘅 如果唔計 Roomba 有幾多人屋企係有機械人嘅？ 
 So a couple. ||| 都有幾個 
 That's okay. ||| 冇問題 
 That's the problem that we're trying to solve at Romotive — that I and the other 20 nerds at Romotive are obsessed with solving. ||| 呢個就係我哋 Romotive  要解決嘅問題 亦係我同廿位喺 Romotive 嘅發燒友 成日想解決嘅 
 So we really want to build a robot that anyone can use, whether you're eight or 80. ||| 我哋好想整到一個人人都用得嘅機械人 無論你係八歲或者八十歲都用得 
 This robot can't be creepy or uncanny. ||| 呢個機械人嘅樣唔可以好得人驚 同埋唔可以唔自然 
 He should be friendly and cute. ||| 佢應該要有親切感同埋好得意嘅 
 So meet Romo. ||| 所以有請 Romo 
 Romo's a robot that uses a device you already know and love — your iPhone — as his brain. ||| Romo 淨係需要 一個大家都識嘅裝置 即係你嘅 iPhone——控制 
 When Romo wakes up, he's in creature mode. ||| 當 Romo 醒咗之後，佢會進入生物狀態 
 So he's actually using the video camera on the device to follow my face. ||| 亦即係話佢係用攝影機嚟捕捉我塊臉 
 He's wary, so he'll keep his eyes on me. ||| 佢好著緊，所以佢會望實我 
 If I come over here, he'll turn to follow me. ||| 如果我過嚟呢度，佢會轉過嚟跟住我 
 If I come over here — (Laughs) He's smart. ||| 如果我嚟呢度（笑聲） 佢好精靈 
 And if I get too close to him, he gets scared just like any other creature. ||| 跟住，如果我太近佢 佢就會好似其他動物咁嚇襯 
 So in a lot of ways, Romo is like a pet that has a mind of his own. ||| 喺好多方面，Romo 好似寵物咁 有自己嘅思想 
 Thanks, little guy. ||| 唔該你，機械人 
 And if I want to explore the world — uh-oh, Romo's tired — if I want to explore the world with Romo, I can actually connect him from any other iOS device. ||| 然後如果我想去探索世界 ——噢，Romo 攰啦 咁如果我想同 Romo 一齊探索世界嘅話 我可以直接將佢同任何 iOS 裝置連接 
 So here's the iPad. ||| 呢度有個 iPad 
 And Romo will actually stream video to this device. ||| Romo 會將現場畫面傳送到呢部機度 
 So I can see everything that Romo sees, and I get a robot's-eye-view of the world. ||| 所以我可以睇到 Romo 睇到嘅嘢 同埋擁有機械人嘅視界 
 Now this is a free app on the App Store, so if any of you guys had this app on your phones, we could literally right now share control of the robot and play games together. ||| 而家呢個程式喺 App Store 係免費嘅 所以如果你哋手機入邊有呢個程式嘅話 我們可以一齊現場控制機械人同玩遊戲 
 So I'll show you really quickly, Romo actually — he's streaming video, so you can see me and the entire TED audience. ||| 咁我而家就好快趣畀大家睇下… Romo 事實上——佢喺度直播緊 你可以睇到我同埋成班 TED 觀眾 
 If I get in front of Romo here. ||| 如果我跑到 Romo 嘅前面 
 And if I want to control him, I can just drive. ||| 如果我想要控制佢，我可以直接駕駛佢 
 So I'll snap a picture. ||| 咁等我影返幅先 
 And in the same way that you scroll through content on an iPad, I can actually adjust the angle of the camera on the device. ||| 好似你碌 iPad 一樣 我可以碌螢幕嚟控制 機械人上面攝影機嘅角度 
 So there are all of you through Romo's eyes. ||| 呢個就係 Romo 眼中嘅你哋啦 
 And finally, because Romo is an extension of me, I can express myself through his emotions. ||| 仲有，因為 Romo 係我嘅工具 所以我可以利用佢嚟表達我嘅心情 
 You do not have to teach someone how to drive Romo. ||| 你唔需要教人點樣去控制 Romo 
 In fact, who would like to drive a robot? ||| 其實而家有冇人想控制個機械人？ 
 Okay. Awesome. ||| 太好啦 
 Here you go. ||| 畀你 
 Thank you, Scott. ||| 唔該晒 Scott 
 And even cooler, you actually don't have to be in the same geographic location as the robot to control him. ||| 更加正嘅係 你唔需要喺機械人所在嘅位置 控制機械人 
 That girl can take her iPhone, put it on the robot, send an email to Grandma, who lives on the other side of the country. ||| 呢個女仔可以將佢嘅 iPhone  放喺個機械人上 然後寄一封電郵 畀住喺另一笪地方嘅阿嫲 
 Thanks, Scott. ||| 唔該晒，Scott 
 This is actually something that one of our engineers, Dom, built in a weekend. ||| 呢個其實係我哋其中一位工程師 Dom 喺週末做出來嘅 
 It's built on top of a Google open framework called Blockly. ||| 佢用一個叫做 Blockly 嘅 Google 公開系統開發 
 And then if you have something you're proud of, you can share it with every other person who owns a robot in the world. ||| 如果你有啲你自豪嘅嘢 你可以將佢同全球嘅機械人主人分享 
 So all of these wi-fi–enabled robots actually learn from each other. ||| 所以呢，呢啲有無線功能嘅機械人 其實會互相學習 
 The reason we're so focused on building robots that everyone can train is that we think the most compelling use cases in personal robotics are personal. ||| 我哋之所以要全心全意製造出 任何人都可以訓練嘅機械人 係因為我哋認為私人機械人 最重要嘅嘢在於個人化 
 They change from person to person. ||| 人人對機械人嘅需要都唔同 
 So we think that if you're going to have a robot in your home, that robot ought to be a manifestation of your own imagination. ||| 所以我哋覺得如果你想喺屋企 整返個機械人嘅話 咁你需要用你嘅想像力 去設計呢個機械人 
 So I wish that I could tell you what the future of personal robotics looks like. ||| 我希望我可以同你講到 末來個人機械人係點樣 
 To be honest, I have no idea. ||| 但老實講，我自己都唔知 
 But what we do know is that it isn't 10 years or 10 billion dollars or a large humanoid robot away. ||| 但係我哋可以好肯定佢唔使一百億 唔使等十年或者等人形機械人出現之後 
 The future of personal robotics is happening today, and it's going to depend on small, agile robots like Romo and the creativity of people like yourselves. ||| 個人機械人嘅未來就係喺今日 機械人會好似 Romo 一樣小型、敏捷 同埋按大家嘅創意去設計 
 ♪ Ooh baby ♪ ♪ baby ♪ ♪ baby ♪ ♪ baby ♪ (Baby crying) ♪ baby ♪ (Baby crying) ♪ baby ♪ (Cat meowing) (Dog barking) Yeah. ||| ♪ 哦奀咕 ♪ ♪ 奀咕 ♪ ♪ 奀咕 ♪ ♪ 奀咕 ♪（嬰兒哭聲） ♪ 奀咕 ♪（嬰兒哭聲） ♪ 奀咕 ♪（貓叫） （狗吠） 耶！ 
 As you can probably well imagine, I was a strange child. ||| 所以你哋大概都可以想像到 我細個係一個好奇怪嘅細路 
 I was constantly experimenting with these noises. ||| 我一直以嚟都喺度試緊呢啲聲音 
 And there's things that no one's voice can do. ||| 而且，有啲嘢係人把聲無可能做到嘅 
 And it hurts your throat. ||| 而且會傷害你嘅喉嚨 
 So I've been working with these guys, and we've made a machine. ||| 於是我同呢啲人合作 我哋整咗部機器 
 And I'm going to show you what it can do. ||| 我宜家會示範佢可以做啲乜嘢 
 But if you want to do something a little bit more immediate, something that you can't achieve with live looping, there's other ways to layer your voice up. ||| 但係如果你想做得更加即時 又或者想做實時循環 做唔到嘅嘢 你有其他方法鋪你把聲上去 
 (Beatboxing) There's always got to be a bit of a dance at the start, because it's just fun, so you can clap along if you want. ||| （節奏口技） 一開始都會有少少嘅舞蹈 因為咁樣好得意 如果你可以鍾意嘅話 可以跟住一齊打節拍 
 You don't have to. It's fine. Check it out. ||| 宜家聽下我加低音 
 Which is nice. But what if I want to make, say, a — (Applause) — Thanks. What if I want to make, say, a rock organ? ||| 個音出嚟好好 多謝。假設我想做，例如，搖滾風琴？ 
 Is that possible? Yes, it is, by recording myself like this. ||| 有冇可能呢？係可以嘅 只要好我咁樣錄低我把聲 
 (Organ sound) And now I have that, I have that recorded. ||| （風琴聲） 跟住，宜家我有頭先嗰個錄音 
 Impossible, you say. No. ||| 冇可能，你哋覺得，冇可能 
 It is possible, and you can do it very simply using this machine. It's really fantastic. Check it out. ||| 係有可能嘅，而且你可以用呢部機 非常簡單就做到。真係好神奇。聽下 
 (Music) So every noise you can hear there is my voice. ||| （音樂） 所以所有你聽得到嘅聲音 都係嚟自我把聲 
 I didn't just trigger something which sounds like that. ||| 我整咗呢啲聲音 
 There's no samples. There's no synthesizers. ||| 我係冇用到樣本音樂，冇合成 
 Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. ||| 好多謝各位 
 Tonight, I'm going to share with you my passion for science. ||| 今晚，我想同大家分享我對科學嘅熱愛 
 I'm not talking about science that takes baby steps. ||| 不過唔係講細步細步發展嘅科學 
 I'm talking about science that takes enormous leaps. ||| 而係快速發展嘅科學 
 In a moment, I'm going to talk about two ideas that might do this. ||| 等陣，我會列舉兩個 可能做到顛覆世界嘅嘢 
 They were identical except for one thing. ||| 兩間診所基本上係一样嘅，除咗一樣 
 Sanitation? No. ||| 衛生？唔係 
 Medical procedures? No. ||| 醫療過程？唔係 
 Air flow? No. ||| 診所空氣流通？唔係 
 How was that possible? ||| 點可能？ 
 How could a male doctor get the same thing as new mothers? ||| 一個男醫生點會得到同產婦一樣嘅病？ 
 Had something gotten in his wound that killed him? ||| 所以會唔會係有嘢入咗佢個傷口 令佢感染至死？ 
 He found that bacteria were the culprits. ||| 佢發現細菌係罪魁禍首 
 We now look at what I want to talk about tonight, in two ideas. ||| 宜家，我哋嚟睇下今晚我想講嘅兩樣嘢 
 We saw it with Semmelweis, that he was a revolutionary. ||| 我哋認為 Ignaz Semmelweis  係一個革命者 
 He did it for two reasons. ||| 原因有兩個 
 One, he opened our eyes to a completely new world. ||| 一，佢帶領我哋到一個全新嘅世界 
 We'd known since the 1680s about bacteria. ||| 1680 年以來，人類就已經知道細菌 
 We just didn't know that bacteria killed people. ||| 淨係唔知細菌可以致命 
 And he also demolished fond ideas that people kept close to their heart. ||| 佢仲推翻 大家心中根深蒂固嘅愚念 
 Miasmas didn't kill people. Bacteria killed people. ||| 唔係瘴氣，而係細菌令人死亡 
 So this brings me to the two ideas I want to talk about tonight. ||| 呢個就帶出咗我今晚想講嘅兩樣嘢 
 One has opened our eyes to a completely new universe, and the other attacks long-held beliefs. ||| 一就係世人已經見到全新嘅世界 另一個就係衝擊舊觀念 
 Betzig is a true rebel. ||| Eric Betzig 係一個真正嘅革命者 
 So he became a househusband, but he never lost his passion for figuring out how to get microscopes to see finer and finer details than had ever been seen before or ever could be seen. ||| 所以，佢變成一個全職家庭主夫 但係，佢嘅熱情不減 佢熱衷於研究點樣可以令顯微鏡 睇到比以前更加清晰嘅細節 
 There's just one problem. ||| 不過，有一個問題 
 There's this thing called the law of physics, and part of the law of physics is the thing called the diffraction limit. ||| 有一樣嘢叫物理定律 物理定律當中有一條定律叫繞射極限 
 """Aha!"" Betzig said." ||| Eric Betzig 話︰ 
 So he lashed together a microscope in his friend's living room. ||| 佢喺朋友嘅客廳度安裝咗一台顯微鏡 
 He had no laboratory. ||| 佢冇實驗室 
 For this work, last year, Eric Betzig won the Nobel Prize. ||| 因為呢次嘅努力 Eric Betzig 舊年獲得咗諾貝爾獎 
 Why? ||| 點解？ 
 But do you think Betzig was satisfied there? ||| 但係，你以為 Eric Betzig 就咁就滿足？ 
 No. ||| 絕對唔係 
 So what did he do? ||| 咁佢做咗點咩？ 
 He came up with a 200-year-old idea called moiré patterns. ||| 佢諗到一個有二百年歷史嘅方法 叫做莫列波紋 
 Unfortunately, viruses sometimes hijack those to infect cells. ||| 但係病毒有時候會 控制佢哋從而攻擊細胞 
 Also, you see those little squiggly wormlike things moving around? ||| 你睇到嗰啲四圍游動 彎彎曲曲好似蠕蟲噉嘅嘢 
 Now that we can look at movies of what's actually going on deep inside a cell, we have a much better chance of curing viral diseases like AIDS. ||| 宜家我哋能夠睇到 細胞深處活動嘅動態畫面 令我哋有更大機會 醫好愛滋病等嘅病毒型疾病 
 So when you look at a movie like this, it's very clear that Betzig has opened our eyes to a completely new world. ||| 所以當你睇到噉樣嘅動畫 Eric Betzig 已經 將我哋帶到一個全新嘅世界 
 But he hasn't shattered any cherished beliefs. ||| 但係佢未改變大家深信不疑嘅觀點 
 That leads us to Dr. Aubrey de Grey at Cambridge. ||| 所以我哋嚟講下 Aubrey de Grey 博士 佢嚟自劍橋 
 De Grey definitely has scientists squirming with an interesting idea: we can be immortal. ||| 佢絕對有令科學家坐立不安嘅奇思妙想 我哋可以長生 
 We can beat aging. ||| 我哋可以戰勝衰老 
 Now, most scientists think he's a crackpot. ||| 多數科學家覺得佢係一個怪胎 
 Any Biology 101 student knows that aging is an inevitable consequence of living. ||| 讀生物嘅學生都知道 衰老係無可避免嘅，係生命嘅必然結果 
 For example, when we eat, we take in food and we metabolize it, and that throws off what we call free radicals. ||| 例如，我哋食嘢嘅時候 我哋攝取食物跟住用咗佢 呢個過程會產生所謂嘅自由基 
 Also known as oxygen ions, those bind to our DNA, cause it to mutate, and cause us to get old and lose our hair. ||| 佢哋又叫做氧離子 佢哋黐住我哋嘅 DNA 令 DNA 突變 使到我哋變老同甩哂頭髮 
 So you age because you rust out. ||| 你之所以變老係因為你生銹 
 So if you stop aging, all of you are going to turn into giant walking malignant tumors. ||| 如果你唔衰老 你哋就變成活生生、超大嘅惡性腫瘤 
 One more thing. ||| 而且 
 Bristlecone pine trees live 5,000 years, and some lobsters don't age at all. ||| 狐尾松樹壽命有五千年 有啲龍蝦根本唔會哀老 
 Now, this doesn't mean that de Grey is going to revolutionize our lifespans. ||| 唔係話 Aubrey de Grey  會為我哋嘅壽命帶嚟革命性嘅變化 
 Consider this: there are seven times more people alive today than during Darwin's time. ||| 睇下幅圖︰ 宜家嘅人口數目係達爾文當時嘅七倍 
 There are four times as many people alive today as Einstein. ||| 係愛因斯坦當時嘅四倍 
 When you consider that the proportion of scientists in the population has skyrocketed, there are now seven million scientists. ||| 你諗下 人口中嘅科學家比例暴漲 宜家有七百萬個科學家
